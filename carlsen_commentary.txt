00:48
okay so here we go ready for the final
00:55
and yeah I get white in the first game
01:01
gonna go d4 Knight f3 well it just goes
01:08
for Queens gambit I expected something
01:12
something something sharper the Ragozin
01:15
of of all things now let me take, let's
01:19
see what he's got in mind
01:22
he castles
01:26
hmm,yeah, I'm going to go e3, h6
01:30
bishop h4 he is probably gonna go bishop
01:32
f5 okay let me try a queen
01:36
b3 he takes it
01:40
Queen c3 I guess
01:43
oh yeah that's right
01:48
g5 immediately it's actually good I
01:51
forgot about that
01:55
no clue what to do here but I didn't
02:00
feel too keen on taking that pawn on c7 okay
02:04
I should do something else in the next
02:06
game cuz I don't want to don't want to
02:08
run into his preparation but at least
02:11
he's thinking now so I'm assuming else he has
02:14
bunch of good options here like h5 also
02:17
looked good so now I guess Bishop b5
02:22
suspect I want to take that next if
02:24
given a chance
02:28
if knight c6 maybe I'll go Knight d2 if
02:32
he takes King d2 - I think my King is
02:34
more or less fine in the center and if
02:37
Knight g3 hg at least I got a normal
02:40
position
02:43
and I could always claim umm that umm I can okay
02:51
so that's a clever move huh uh
02:56
yeah bishop d3 probably takes on d2 - I'm
03:01
gonna do that anyway
03:06
the thing is if he if he went like
03:09
Knight d2 King d2 - I would have gone
03:12
Bishop e2 - and if he had would have gone Knight g3
03:15
hg c6 then I would probably I wanted to
03:19
trade the bishops
03:23
ummm the difference being something about the
03:26
dark squares no sorry the light squares
03:29
on the on the kingside with with the h
03:34
file opened compared to to this where my
03:36
King is in the center now I think I'm
03:38
doing fine I'm intending h4 pretty soon
03:42
and my King is perfectly safe
03:46
he goes for f5 but seems bit overzealous
03:52
to me I go h4 he goes g4 maybe I
03:58
don't achieve that much so I could go g4 as
04:02
well
04:04
if he goes F G maybe I'll go h4
04:11
yeah I'm just going to do that
04:17
no reason to be scared
04:21
f4 as well
04:24
think I'm gonna go h4
04:29
and my queen is protecting my king very
04:34
well so this move I don't like for him now
04:37
I get Bishop e5 with tempo
04:39
I'm going h4 next oh and I just
04:43
missed this okay
04:46
yeah that's why I never
04:49
underestimates Alireza so he's
04:51
devilishly tricky okay so he takes Hg
04:57
rook h5 I think I'm still doing
05:00
pretty well I think he should probably
05:03
have gone
05:03
Rook e5 then knight e5 because then my
05:05
queen would have been kicked away at the
05:11
very least so I can go rook h1
05:16
yeah I probably don't have a whole lot
05:19
hear still so okay let me just go b3
05:20
protect my stuff
05:23
Queen f4
05:26
probably a very good move which I completely
05:29
missed
05:31
huh
05:35
I can not go Rook g4 because queen g4
05:40
that's the that's the main issue here I
05:43
can't go queen d4 no I can't go Queen
05:46
d4 maybe I have Queen f5 actually
05:54
ah, he takes that rook
05:56
okay I'm gonna lose hoping for f4
06:01
But I think he's just got way too
06:05
much time here but I'm gonna try and
06:09
flag him of course
06:12
no chance here
06:15
d3 rook d7 and I'm barely up on time
06:26
and see if I can get him to stalemate
06:39
me here I'm assuming there's no chance
06:42
okay yeah no chance yeah this is gonna
06:48
be tough rook f6!
06:52
yeah I should have should have just
06:55
assumed he was going to to try and trick
06:58
me they're not just believe that he
07:01
made a poor move he's too good for that
07:05
okay so I'm going for the Alekhine
07:10
trying once again to now well at least
07:16
in this game see if I can get a time
07:18
advantage hold on
07:20
she's allowing c5 so I guess I should
07:23
just go for that
07:26
I think he's played to passively him
07:30
probably CD Queen d4 I got 96 pcs six
07:40
should have enough fix T of T is to
07:43
compensate for the slightly worse
07:45
structure if you've done Queenie five
07:47
quindi five woulda got Knight d5 that I
07:51
would have been perfectly fine um yeah
07:55
you fine I guess
07:57
you
08:03
bismuth Bishop g4 o f6 Bishop h6 yeah so
08:09
you should just do this instead Bishop
08:15
g5 clever routine AIDS
08:21
night c4i garbage base 6 I'm not worried
08:24
about that
08:26
you
08:36
IOH 6:45 cd5 take which would be 6 takes
08:41
takes and then I take on any two should
08:44
be it should be perfectly fine for me
08:48
now I think I have got a 6 and then you
08:53
for take it cool bishops III but don't
09:01
think that really really works let me
09:03
just centralize the King rook the AIDS
09:09
so he wants to go a 95 now
09:19
[Music]
09:21
it's coming
09:25
what should I do about that
09:29
okay try Ricky 695 47
09:38
he goes we should be three guys 47 gypsy
09:44
five maybe g5 trying to expand okay I'm
10:03
hesitating a bit too much now before I'm
10:17
probably going to rugby Salmond okay so
10:21
he goes for this one okay so I'll just
10:30
go for King e7 I'm not loving the the
10:36
isolated pawn here but okay when I get
10:40
the chance I think I'm gonna I'm gonna
10:43
escape so I miss 95 but I don't think it
10:46
was a big deal
10:48
okay Knight of 6 I'm not just gonna try
10:50
and try and make a Drona g5 push King d5
10:56
King D 3 I'm going f4 probably a little
11:00
bit better
11:02
Knight most I got I got a 4 followed by
11:06
95 continue to push
11:12
can you for
11:18
I'm definitely whole lot better now
11:20
probably winning this is very annoying
11:29
though takes a B and that is got 96 is
11:36
he really gonna escape on me this is
11:44
super annoying
12:00
you can go 96 okay this is just gonna be
12:13
a draw don't like it I feel like I was I
12:21
was doing well in that game and I was
12:24
probably a bit too hasty and trying to
12:27
convert it you see what he's got in mind
12:34
here
12:35
I'll go d3 just try and play normal sort
12:42
of close Spanish position c3 now and
12:49
yeah this is what Shakira did against me
12:51
in the previous match but without the
12:54
pawn and beef island in that game I
12:56
think I ended up castling queenside and
12:58
my point is now that after he's actually
13:02
gonna be five and queenside castling is
13:05
less of an option so that should be
13:07
favorable for me I don't know if I'm
13:13
playing this to accurately Oh 97 that's
13:19
very surprising I guess I'll take one
13:22
night h4
13:25
I don't think that was called for an
13:26
all-night g6 I did Queen h5 looks the
13:31
looks very promising for me yeah Queen
13:37
h5 now King T 7 yeah this is this is I
13:49
think not very good how to be precise
13:55
though you can use got Queen g5 so
13:58
logical option is just to go g3 Queen g5
14:00
drop the Queen back higher got anything
14:03
better
14:04
Phil Knight a5 Queen g5 no I think I'm
14:11
just gonna go g3 drop the Queen your
14:15
tanks I take feel like I still got some
14:18
some pressure mmm
14:26
yeah a knight of three may be intending
14:28
d4 Queen g6 she anticipates that yes I'm
14:41
gonna try and be more clever good D for
14:44
now
14:49
I am going out of three and then CD
14:53
and then his filter Queen g6 let's check
14:58
on B if I was nothing special so
15:00
probably easy I gotta go CD was sort of
15:05
my backup option then Bishop t-49 of
15:10
three queen c5 maybe you can you can
15:14
make my work technically certainly
15:25
thinking a lot now
15:34
sure these are some of the things he's
15:36
considering yeah so okay I guess I
15:43
should tank the trip day for a night of
15:46
three Queen c5 I don't really see what
15:47
to do though I also been castle or take
15:51
the four but then I got a protectee for
15:54
as well
15:56
[Music]
16:02
now I think I'm just Castle fe3 and then
16:05
I got a square on I got a square on d4
16:09
as well
16:10
rusty one coming I think position is not
16:14
going to be too easy for him to play so
16:18
I take your Knight d4 I guess he's
16:25
probably gonna go c5 then I try and kick
16:29
kick his queen with a 3 mm yeah rook if
16:35
6 is very tempting
16:38
CD for Queen G for yes that's very good
16:55
it's going to be hard-pressed
16:58
defend us especially with so little time
17:00
and he tries to go for some counter play
17:03
but don't think it's gonna work out
17:07
could be wrong rook c7 threatens mates
17:12
on two squares
17:15
yeah Kingi Taurua Queenie - arica -
17:17
that's gonna be game over now this is
17:20
great
17:21
okay even the score very important this
17:27
is gonna be a rough match it's not gonna
17:31
be easy at all so let me try it the
17:33
other kin again because I feel like
17:34
position I got was pretty good goes with
17:40
the bishop to a different Square this
17:42
time
17:44
but I'm not convinced by this either I
17:52
receive five takes I got night before
17:56
okay let me just go 97 play more or less
18:00
normally yeah now we'll go see five when
18:03
I still have the chance
18:12
yeah you can do this but I'm late at
18:15
least I'm getting this Bishop hey I can
18:19
also go be five let me just go be five
18:22
actually there should be four I got nine
18:26
of six no d6 shenanigans if you move the
18:29
bishop I got be ca3 I always have 93
18:38
okay let me plan out of six so it's
18:45
trying to be very tricky oh I missed
18:49
something
18:50
I thought about takes rookie for her
18:53
than Bishop f5 that doesn't work you can
18:56
still you can just go ap immediately
19:01
okay so I got to do this instead 96 I
19:07
suppose takes 94 I don't I don't like it
19:14
too much but I didn't feel like I had a
19:19
lot of choice um obviously you got it
19:23
he's got a pretty fearsome set of the
19:26
pawn something on d5 and c5 but
19:33
they can also be able to lose and I have
19:38
a little bit of an initiative at the
19:40
moment so let's see if I can use that to
19:47
my advantage
19:49
privilege it almighty for decentralized
19:52
the night I know the b2 is hanging but I
19:56
don't think that's massively important
20:01
so you guys night a4 it's a bit
20:05
surprising
20:05
g6 now d6 Bishop e7 doesn't look too bad
20:13
not if not an a4 could be very much out
20:16
of play she goes da six I got this b6
20:22
should be fine so you're gonna you got
20:24
two connected passers but I feel like
20:27
all of my pieces are doing pretty well
20:30
at the moment so I don't think this
20:32
should be clear at all so did you miss
20:34
Bishop f3 or you're trying to trick me
20:37
so mama Bishop f3
20:43
Quincy one that must be the point
20:48
I don't think I am refute that
20:57
that's reading ring if it just lucked
21:00
into a good longer nice when it could be
21:04
three nights
21:16
okay I got a play I gotta play faster so
21:21
gif I'm gonna go 96 but I'm not I'm not
21:25
liking it too much I'm hoping the fact
21:39
that his knight could still be some way
21:43
out of joining the game could swing the
21:47
the balance in my favor but yeah as I
21:52
said not liking it too much yeah so
21:57
queer 5 trying to keep his queen from
22:03
getting to defy which I could think
22:04
could have been pretty bad news for me
22:06
okay Queen King h8 obviously Queen a5 I
22:11
think
22:12
d7 I go group d8 I also got g4
22:17
they're coming up yeah 25 quite sensibly
22:24
I don't have time to think
22:31
aquinnah for wanna go G for next fuck I
22:36
have to create that kind of planet Queen
22:38
c7 okay I'm gonna
22:41
I shouldn't should not take you probably
22:47
this was just really bad
22:49
okay trying to prevent nuts see if I
22:52
were to released now I think my position
22:55
is sort of okay but I'm losing on time
22:59
that's okay yeah still there might be
23:01
six Brooke f6 sort of mmm I'm listing
23:16
time that's problem yeah okay decision
23:22
got too too complicated not good
23:27
let me try this again feels like a
23:32
decent enough trace against him okay so
23:48
he goes he goes for a different system
23:51
now guess I'm just gonna play it pretty
23:59
slowly
24:07
okay nine of one so he's going for this
24:13
plan she wants to go maybe your 94 I'll
24:19
make sure anyway
24:24
preventing night h5 so actually getting
24:27
f5 is a bit more difficult friend okay
24:31
so I could take or so I could go CD yeah
24:39
I'm just go seeking feels feels a bit
24:46
easier to play
24:56
Bishop d7 on probably oh I'm just
25:00
completely blind what am I even doing
25:03
I'm just completely missing that I got
25:06
the threat of CD and ambushed by three
25:09
winning the exchange
25:17
that's just no good at all now there
25:22
should be five a for just no good square
25:24
for the bishop so Bishop d6 d4 Knight d7
25:29
I'm a d4 ninety four hours ago
25:31
d4 taking his bishop again so this is
25:34
what he has to do but still de 1944 d5 h
25:43
three I think I'm just winning
25:50
he's come try and muddy the waters some
25:54
way but I don't really see it yeah 94
26:00
just didn't work which was lucky for me
26:02
since that's not something I'd spotted
26:04
from from afar but it's not that big a
26:10
surprise I can fish g5 right
26:13
you
26:18
yeah f6i technic Bishop f6 Bishop h6
26:24
right
26:31
okay one okay this is gonna go over very
26:39
very soon ninety-four he's six
26:50
she's so many winning moves don't even
26:53
wanna lock in
26:54
f7 though he's gonna resign okay
26:59
evening the score again with this this
27:03
is a tough match okay let me try
27:05
something else
27:07
enough of this alien nonsense what does
27:12
he want does he want P 64 I don't know
27:16
let me go a sick since I don't know what
27:30
to do here
27:31
g4 maybe can't be too mad so I'll take
27:37
it 96 develop normally and a6 it's not
27:41
ideal but at least it's preparing d5 so
27:49
don't think it's really a bad thing
27:52
he wants to go see three
27:54
for but I'm not really sure whether I
28:00
will actually allow that 97 fruity one I
28:04
got 95 maybe also I got c4 Queen b6 as
28:11
an option I can also just allow it take
28:15
and Queen b6 a bitch b3 I can take on b2
28:21
it's an interesting position but I
28:26
shouldn't repeat my mistake of just
28:30
getting way too low in time huh okay let
28:34
me just go for this c4 you can go they
28:39
can go b3 somehow it wasn't too worried
28:43
about this one so I feel like the
28:45
structure even if you gots to take and
28:47
on c4 will not be too bad for me I'm
28:51
just missing f4 and what's linked what
28:53
is up with me you can just win a pawn
28:58
that it's just saying yeah not good yeah
29:09
position is not hopeless which is not
29:14
ideal
29:16
my day far
29:18
d 3 then B fire doesn't seem to work
29:22
yeah okay fine
29:26
Guinan when i finally gonna try that
29:29
rook d7 queen a two other feeling that
29:32
if I could be strong on if he does go d3
29:36
then he will have at least weaken some
29:39
school yeah but now he's weakened some
29:41
squares I got I got rook b8 take it he's
29:48
got a e5 now but at least I got Ruby to
29:51
maybe it's nothing
29:56
yeah just working one ok let me try this
29:58
instead
30:09
Gentile
30:10
cracking throat oh he goes Queenie for
30:14
rooks yet what is his point he wants to
30:17
go ahead fine yeah well no at least I
30:21
got my pawn back go on some sort of
30:26
expedition with the Queen should not be
30:30
too bad now I got some squares for the
30:33
bishop my life is very very bad
30:36
that's a problem g5 I don't think was a
30:38
great move g4 I mean this one whoever is
30:43
a bit tricky to meet uh-huh he wants to
30:48
go g5 I'm just gonna go G find myself
30:53
not loving it though
30:55
I gotta speed up that's my manager here
31:08
yeah he gets this one it's not not ideal
31:19
that's not kind of play with Knight b3
31:21
coming up don't know exactly what kind
31:25
of player but there should be some will
31:27
Queen b6 is a good move the King g7
31:31
though is working fades 95 I'm just
31:41
gonna have to yeah I'm just gonna have
31:42
to sack that night take it does feel
31:53
from a practical point of view that this
31:55
is far from lost 95 okay I guess I'll go
32:01
Rudy Nate Rudy two of just trying to
32:08
keep some activity next I just want to
32:11
push the aid and pawn my King is pretty
32:15
safe that's a good thing Queen B -
32:26
keeping some pressure there a3 if it
32:28
tastes already four can't take now at
32:38
the release my position is
32:39
ike objectively speaking but I have
32:42
serious problems with time of course
32:47
that was stupid now it's just gonna flag
32:50
me
32:50
oh that's the repetition okay I guess
32:57
good for me I was a piece down suffering
32:59
most of the game so the drawer should be
33:04
fine
33:05
okay so no more e6 sorry no more d5 you
33:15
wants to yeah he doesn't want you need
33:25
to have that easier life so they're just
33:29
I'm gonna go you five now the point is
33:35
if I allow Castle then night yet can
33:39
sometimes be a good move sort of
33:44
claiming that this is more precise now
33:46
of course he can go d4 and then he
33:49
doesn't actually have to to Castle
33:52
kingside so it's most certainly a
33:54
double-edged sword but at least we got
33:57
some sort of strategical fight here
33:59
should be good for me just way too much
34:02
street fighting when I'm in my black
34:05
games I'm really missing a lot of a lot
34:10
of tactical stuff mmm
34:14
Queen c7 looks very dubious yes I'll
34:18
take 93 what's this intention yeah 96
34:37
now I guess you can play this way I'm
34:41
gonna go fish before should be 6h for
34:53
probably when you go 95 next although
34:57
I'm allowing 94 and that I'm not loving
35:05
castles I guess hmm I probably haven't
35:17
played this very incisively but at least
35:26
it's going to be sort of difficult
35:28
friend to castle right as I said that he
35:33
does castles Queen site with no regards
35:37
for regard for Humanity 0h5 okay let me
35:50
pay for just trying to know him over
35:52
there okay
36:01
jump into b5 or is hoping that g5
36:05
doesn't make me
36:14
now take it
36:16
95 Bishop g5 next yeah it was for this
36:44
may be a bishop yet I think I for looks
36:47
ok takes it now I take back and our
36:57
Bishop f6 wreckage 3
37:06
got three so I'm not massively worried
37:09
about that now I want to go king f2 and
37:11
then rock h1 that's what I missed
37:16
okay I gotta protect okay whoopsie woman
37:23
I'm missing the a for his hanging
37:26
unbelievable so bad and know there was a
37:31
reason I shouldn't do that now our
37:33
position is just collapsing see three of
37:38
listen trying to forage I have a feeling
37:44
this is not going to look cool
37:45
this is not gonna end well for me okay
37:53
one he's got beef I though just to solid
37:59
don't know it to be here Queenie - well
38:03
I'm see for now at least I get to read
38:07
appoint take any fun what's the problem
38:12
Queen c6 queen of three gesso goes
38:15
Queen's off then I got to take a beat
38:19
595 I didn't say that hmm my bishop is
38:30
really badly out of play
38:32
okay okay my blunder Brooke this way
38:38
instead huh afternoon okay I'm just
38:45
gonna resign that was so bad so so bad
38:49
wait why can't I just make some some
38:56
some solid moves when I have the chance
38:58
instead of all this nonsense
39:02
unbelievable sessions I'm just
39:10
completely
39:10
collapsing in this case
39:17
you
39:19
I do have the feeling that my position
39:22
was just kind of good from the opening
39:24
here so I'm not true averse to repeating
39:26
so I'm just gonna take the bishop my
39:28
thing gonna be fine none of the more
39:31
allowing fish before okay and that be
39:36
six I guess we should bet five so there
39:42
should be seven I guess I got this pizza
39:50
nice English piece on
40:00
yeah Bishop e7 97 Queen d8 root D aids
40:09
rookie 7 Bishop f3 work t2 I guess I can
40:12
make a draw my a for looks a bit weird
40:27
okay so exists
40:28
CIT still got calendar works and it's
40:36
too rubbish p7 but I can play c4 then
40:44
try and be a bit clever yeah that is
41:02
clever I 97 is got Queen design so I got
41:06
to trade this way and I don't get the
41:08
rogue - I don't get the rogue - okay I'm
41:14
just gonna take them route p8 this is
41:20
gonna be a draw although yes
41:29
I advise someone precisely but takes
41:39
things work a 7 roof d8 roof t7 let's
41:44
feel a bit tricky
41:45
Brooke t2 no it's not an obvious strong
41:51
so bad just so bad so give a check now
41:57
for lack of any better ideas trying to
42:08
somehow displaces rook e8 I want to play
42:28
for a win don't know one
42:32
what justification I just I can't keep
42:35
begging for a draw okay five kage five
42:44
take age for this is got Ruby fly though
42:48
so he's okay then I take 58 choice for
42:56
this hmm I guess that's clever
43:04
that was a mild sleep I wanted to go
43:06
Ruby fine probably was a good sleep
43:08
though unbelievable
43:13
I'll get Bishop d8 and then push I'm not
43:17
worried here
43:18
definitely not worse probably not really
43:26
better either
43:27
okay I gotta play for a while gotta play
43:31
for a win
43:33
let's see six like I broke d1 of Keaney
43:36
to agony true age three sorry but
43:40
obviously it's not this one i I didn't
43:43
see however that's a bit of a blow I
43:50
gotta try and be fast that was a weak
43:58
move I think nom definitely not worse
44:03
would be to I'm better take it
44:09
yeah that's ready five six I guess than
44:16
a five it has no squares for you it's
44:19
night rook F to King g5 and at least
44:26
objectively speaking I'm winning there's
44:30
no stalemate okay okay
44:34
messy game but once again I'm back to
44:38
even
44:41
which I must say is an achievement for
44:44
me so okay enough of that Queens gambit
44:47
nonsense I'm going for simple chess yeah
44:59
maybe what he's doing here is clever see
45:04
397 I cannot prevent e5 okay I'm just
45:07
kind of DC then please I have some good
45:10
memories of my game with with your
45:12
career here from the wind blades
45:17
frightfully secured me in the 120s if b5
45:30
whenever then I just go Bishop c4 so he
45:34
takes he wants to be safe but I think
45:39
it's a little bit worse Bishop e3
45:46
degrees 94 to con I didn't see that
45:55
check okay I'm just gonna trade my lefty
46:02
to maybe six is a bit weird
46:12
96 I missed this one
46:30
yeah that's a bit unfortunate I'm not
46:34
really in time for anything I think e
46:35
for root dat 594 doesn't look very good
46:42
hmm so just go to a three a 94 I'm
46:52
admitting that this didn't go too well
46:56
k2
46:59
a three don't think I'm losing my force
47:07
93 I Roxy 241 it's bit annoying a little
47:26
bit force which I shouldn't British in
47:30
the bin after here are to the opening I
47:40
- 1 - gotta speed up 95 I think I go
47:50
back now that is - maybe you can take I
48:22
don't know we'll see
48:36
yeah
48:39
b5e for take Edie Edie and then BCD for
48:47
his a bit better it's not ideal
48:51
I just five
48:58
oh yeah it's not so easy for me to find
49:01
him up because I'm gonna go can you talk
49:05
but I don't know what I'm doing next - I
49:09
have to go you for and keep the night
49:10
away please got nights now that could be
49:18
annoyingly jumpy I'm very happy to get
49:20
95 oh I think you missed that no I'm
49:25
fine hmm okay 93 I forget before yeah
49:38
yet this one okay let me take it before
49:45
I can you say now he's gonna try and
49:52
fight me I immediately run or something
50:07
okay I'm not you're worried about this
50:09
pawn king do you find it so tricky
50:30
allow the exchange there I'm gonna get
50:33
flagged are you so I know I know that
50:45
this guy is a lot better than the other
50:47
guys I've played but still I mean just
50:49
place just completely on wack it's
50:54
really vexing I mean I'm just constantly
51:00
doubting myself it's all a total mess
51:08
so I'm just assuming that I was doing
51:11
fine in a couple of this games yeah this
51:17
is a very strange ground to have a
51:19
theoretical discussion kind of taken d5
51:36
Knight b6 yeah it's pretty insane just
51:46
to play the extracting decision but I
51:54
got to I've been doing please pretty
51:58
okay the previous can I really do feel
52:05
that okay I have got 96 friend gonna try
52:17
that blundering again net you can take
52:22
him deep in c5 so when I was
52:28
King about mistakes and now 95 then I
52:31
take and then I will Brook d5 this is
52:35
also a blunder by the way because I
52:36
didn't say that East 7 was hanging it is
52:57
still not a disaster for me
53:01
but I don't know maybe we should play
53:04
threes it's a good move bitch was not
53:09
hanging what am I thinking about
53:13
we're like you're thinking about can
53:17
trying this and then go 95 but I don't
53:22
believe it too much that's probably
53:38
clever so you can then I go rook c5 it's
53:47
got to go b6 right you know oh yeah I'm
53:58
gonna try and keep the knight on the
53:59
board I could have gone Knight d5
54:02
probably forcing the trade and then
54:04
would have been fair the dryish but I
54:07
feel like my chances are not too bad
54:11
here from a practical point of view so
54:14
I'm gonna roll the dice just a bit now
54:18
it's a really good move
54:25
yeah publican
54:27
five no I can't do that
54:36
yeah no house to try and hustle here oh
54:41
now I'm gonna try it okay I'm gonna have
54:47
to draw of course okay there's any more
54:53
one I guess five and a half two whatever
55:00
okay goes for this - I don't why I'm
55:06
doing this okay you say so we're gonna
55:10
go G for us at it against natives here
55:12
the other day I do feel that this must
55:17
be a pretty decent liner for me can I go
55:20
age for now I'm gonna do it
55:22
by Katherine list so we got a service
55:29
seven again with these strange moves a
55:34
three and a six included yeah
55:38
don't know what to think about that
55:39
please now Jeff is that the series issue
55:46
okay G 594 totally just gonna take and
55:52
then two fine it might be three yes
56:08
pretty standard carries the tag stuff
56:12
but with the inclusion of courses a
56:15
sticks a knife or 8 a 3 a 3 knife a 6
56:21
and it's not clear that it's to his
56:30
benefit
56:31
Oh although of course a 6 is a more
56:35
standard neither Trevanian move and yeah
56:42
I think it sound so clear that one
56:50
beaver should be three I'm assuming his
56:52
intention is to go 95 next so I was kind
56:56
of wanting to go f4 now
57:02
yeah just Castle looks good 95 UI for
57:07
tank special D for should be friendly up
57:11
in there
57:13
no I'm not push page six there should be
57:17
five takes then keen fades not so sure
57:26
he goes be five I guess I gotta go right
58:02
hmm not too convinced by this month
58:07
because I've taken 54 if ePHI takes
58:11
Bishop h6 r g5 think that's pretty good
58:15
for me let me try it anyway
58:18
Oh Bishop h6 i also got Bishop e3 just a
58:26
blind yeah so he goes rogue h7 now I can
58:31
go can be one also that 5 was
58:34
pro-slavery pretty strong with the same
58:36
idea Bishop h6 and just wish b3 tonight
58:45
a too strong
58:58
totally got it all night at 4:00
59:01
I feel like I'm just considerably better
59:06
right before SpaceX is coming page five
59:44
okay yeah he's trying to complicate it I
59:47
think I'm just I think I'm just winning
59:51
on 93 it's all pretty solid and yeah
59:59
he's got um solvable problems there okay
60:08
okay can you go for try something more
60:15
solid I have six what I beat it with in
60:21
vikon's they should still be still there
60:24
okay right
60:25
unless he's come up with something new
60:29
and brilliant my supposed to be fine I
60:46
guess we should be three
60:50
so it's surprising go age six
61:05
Bhishma six rupees 6495 is playable this
61:11
I don't see your invitation now at d5
61:14
should I have a very decent position she
61:19
doesn't have the usual like Italian sort
61:22
of play with knighted for and everything
61:24
as long as the as long as the bishop is
61:28
and I faked those ideas should not be
61:31
too successful so I'm just trying to
61:34
redeploy here Bishop g7 mmm yeah 97
61:44
looks interesting in 2005 I guess I'm
61:48
just gonna go for that take a five I
62:09
suppose I think I got a fairly
62:19
comfortable position here
62:21
Quincy - I'm just can't talk the King
62:26
away ships a fine
62:31
really sure what the bishop is doing
62:32
there
62:36
no7 there was not such an easy position
62:40
to play as a console to hear having to
62:43
to look for ideas
62:47
yeah we got rid of that that ponen a sex
63:00
your phone is protected so that's not a
63:03
worry
63:03
I'd be several kicking the bishop away
63:06
oh I guess I'll just take it as a matter
63:13
of fact these things not too much
63:20
happening Herod off you go if for
63:25
whenever I want not sure I really want
63:30
that never okay one here's good at this
63:34
just keeping keeping the tension forcing
63:38
people to spend spend a bunch of time
63:44
okay yeah professional looks pretty good
63:49
but there's not that much to do and then
63:58
five Lorraine sleep okay yeah as I said
64:05
the status quo is not great for me since
64:08
I'm a bit slower so I should try and try
64:12
and do something I guess native seven
64:16
let's see four isn't so much I'm kind of
64:20
a knife 793 I'm taking take then he's
64:30
got some good night so it's not clear at
64:33
all but I feel like I should be doing
64:35
okay okay seven
64:46
yeah
65:05
this I honest
65:10
you
65:12
I'll just go 95 16 your Tradeworks yeah
65:17
dude I can't calculate just kind of crap
65:23
late let you fry at age 5 that was my
65:30
idea
65:30
I can't serve running away oh this is
65:41
clever doing take it come on so fucking
66:05
slow I could just have done it actually
66:14
that could be the point that wins me the
66:17
match but he was just getting too
66:19
complacent he thought he'd flagged me
66:22
and then then I got this Wow yeah it's
66:33
not for the faint-hearted hearted huh
66:40
okay let me try it go for this tape I
66:47
should be fine Turner with
66:52
that's
67:05
yeah nobody said it was easy no one ever
67:10
will be so hard
67:24
okay it's a bit tilty right though I
67:32
mean she knows that he probably is
67:43
playing such positions better than I am
67:45
so in that sense is making a good choice
67:49
here
67:52
yeah like already messed up what am i
68:02
doing
68:05
so I was thinking 93 buddy's got
68:08
efficient reform as it's just stupid you
68:12
know age five when I'm just busted
68:37
at the very least of Bishop f3 Queen f3
68:41
Queen h4 h5 I'm still forcing the
68:44
exchange of Queens so it's not that bad
68:48
and it's probably good move bringing the
68:51
roof for
68:59
okay we can ice to do to counter that
69:12
plan
69:25
okay just like I'm thinking he was gonna
69:36
wreck it for they can do this first of
69:39
course so I'm still hanging in there
69:56
sort of night five I guess roof T 494
70:05
looks a bit unpleasant just wrap up my
70:16
own nights and manage not good got some
70:24
fire chances but I'm not optimistic
70:45
sound it again okay I think I've
70:49
celebrated just way too early and I'm
70:55
just now it's six and a half
71:07
all right so its first two two points
71:12
and multiple police don't recall that
71:15
neither washer match goes for this
71:27
[Music]
71:31
do you 593 where's it playing so quickly
71:37
I don't get that it's nothing to be true
71:46
thrilled about here is there for him
71:48
should be 793 castles how the bishop
71:52
pair okay yeah some problems were to put
72:09
this particular mission
72:15
don't really know what to do
72:17
so I'm just gonna play quickly but you
72:20
certainly got some advantage Sharon that
72:22
he's
72:25
and that is fluid walk faster than I
72:27
have
72:33
so neither for a queen Quincy ate here I
72:39
guess I guess I'm going Queen c7 before
72:47
Quincy ate I'll listen getting bit by
72:50
fire I think you should have taken the
72:56
bishop probably had the chance
72:58
thank you so I guess I go see if I at
73:12
some point but I'm allowing matter for
73:17
my journey I'm playing way too
73:31
hesitantly here crispy it up I don't
73:49
like this
74:08
and if ads just try to be solid want to
74:26
connect those rocks
74:32
cringes 3 is massively annoying I kind
74:41
of think can I think yes I can't not
74:46
think cuz what I'm doing without
74:48
thinking is just really bad and no
74:51
instincts right now just none they're
74:55
all gone your position is just lost I
75:00
can I try this but I don't think he's
75:03
just listens yeah I think this just went
75:08
from I was going to route the IPS clean
75:22
so badly just absolutely disgusting I'm
75:34
completely lost
75:55
work if sex was resigns there this is
75:58
always still completely lost if you get
76:12
bit of a mess so completely winning of
76:15
course
76:17
okay that's mate okay I'm just playing
76:21
so badly I got it I got it
76:25
just I really gotta get my own hand at
76:29
this point to know why I'm doing this
76:53
see the ad think this is not considered
77:07
that accurate supposed to be like a
77:12
little bit better here but whether I can
77:15
prove it that's not that's a very big if
77:21
she just going through g4 okay I'm just
77:26
guess I'm just gonna go fridge
77:33
can always go Bishop c2 when i retrace
77:36
the attack d4 and now KH 1 i suppose
78:00
it's a bit weird okay Quinn d3 i
78:04
affinity guess I'm going roof j1 claim
78:08
for g5 at some point yeah so so easy for
78:17
him to play her mm-hmm can go f4 guess
78:37
I'll come just continue developing for
78:40
the moment Queen f6 is left by 95 nah
78:49
gotta wear for all right I'm missing
78:51
something tactically I don't think so
78:57
this is probably a quite strong
79:07
yeah rook informant done at 5:00 it's
79:15
very very good
79:19
okay I'm just quite 5g Frey is coming
79:24
next still chief on it right
79:37
it's got 94 then Rooker for I don't
79:43
think he has anything there before takes
80:07
Queen h5 still alive
80:09
which is a bit annoying okay take it
80:32
without the Queen his Kings it's gonna
80:35
be way too weak I think 23 yeah this
80:44
just came over kitsch English sex
80:53
with janitors scrimmage for 9:06 there's
80:57
Queen h4 King just saw in Queen Giovanna
81:00
okay let me now just continue on this
81:17
path let's go with the with the Sicilian
81:20
this time he still goes 43 but I think
81:26
what he was doing here was not that
81:28
impressive
81:38
no I just scream these six Queens Queen
81:45
feels really funny on the North Korea so
81:47
he goes for this hmm
81:54
Brooks yank the night before is in
81:57
Ashland right before a 392 Queen d3
82:10
probably don't have anything there so
82:15
let me just double rooks
82:27
so much for Space Age 3 now should i do
82:44
then
82:45
94 doesn't really work take everything
82:49
no it doesn't work let me just make
82:55
useful waiting move I'm still not
83:04
completely obvious how he's gonna
83:05
develop no gomini sex I think g5 I got
83:20
95 already tanks if this just wasn't a
83:36
very good move by me no I think this was
83:40
