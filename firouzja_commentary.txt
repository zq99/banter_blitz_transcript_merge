00:17
yes yes now we are playing okay let's
00:33
let's do this let's go bishop b4
00:38
let's see what you got here e d
00:41
so we go castle, e3 we go bishop f5 or
00:47
h6 maybe then bishop f5 so we go
00:53
Bishop f5 he goes probably Queen b3 here
00:57
so we take and yeah ihe takes so now we
01:04
could call g5 I think? we bishop g3 knight b4 if
01:14
he takes on c7 knight c6 is fine so
01:16
let's see what he comes up with
01:19
okay so he goes Queen a3 umm let's see what
01:27
can I do
01:31
um
01:35
let's go knight c6 cannot be bad move
01:42
okay bishop b5 so I could go knight e7 or
01:47
I could go a5 then he has to take I
01:52
take rook c1 okay let's just go knight e7
01:56
he goes knight d2 I could take on d2 and go
02:03
c6 or I could play c6 at first if you want to take
02:11
then it's fine
02:13
probably he should go back with Bishop
02:17
so I don't know where probably to d3 or d2
02:22
I am not sure, d3, okay so he wants to
02:26
attack on
02:27
the h-file I guess, so
02:33
should I go h5? h4? knight g3? fg3? ok I will take
02:45
take and go queen a5 check, he goes King c2
02:54
- okay let's give a check ok he goes king e2
03:03
- let's push f5 I am down on time a
03:10
little bit but it's not a big deal to
03:15
Rook e8, h4 I go g4 I think, and f3 rook
03:30
f6 bishop f5 knight g6 if he takes knight f4 okay
03:38
so what should I do here um okay
03:47
rook f6 bishop f5 rook f7
03:54
okay, lets go rook f6
03:57
bishop f5 rook f7 or knight g6 I got f4 takes...
04:02
this is very complicated but I should go
04:05
for it because if he takes under f6 knight f4!
04:13
okay now it could take, this is very
04:19
dangerous rook h5 and I should go
04:27
for something my queen b4 and now I am down on
04:30
time that is the worst thing I'm
04:33
threatening Queen f4 maybe but he might
04:37
exchange the Queens by queen c3 I cannot
04:42
be worst here, ok let's go queen f4 now 
04:48
he's worse but because rook f5 queen g4 so he
04:53
has to go Queen c3 and he is still
04:56
hanging there um d4 Queen c4 so I
05:01
should take on g5 Queen g4 and it is not clear
05:10
okay okay we could do this I missed okay
05:15
okay I have queen g5 now he blundered the rook
05:18
now it's lost
05:19
okay he wants to flag me here rook e8 rook e4
05:29
king g7 yeah this is lost queen b7 yeah the
05:41
I think I could win this
05:51
I don't know why he's playing on
05:52
okay, this is mate
06:06
okay he blundered queen f4 
06:09
which was very tricky of course it's not
06:11
easy but he had Queen c3 so okay
06:15
first name was good
06:16
so let's go if for those 95 okay place
06:24
down looking because g6 so I mean I have
06:33
a lot of option here should be to Castle
06:38
let's go see three let's play it slow
06:43
how can i play this should've three if
06:51
it takes twenty four so it was 96
07:05
I just take and go Quincy for orphanage
07:09
horrible finish for because if v if v is
07:15
the move proudly and takes on a five but
07:19
it is much it should not be a big deal
07:22
like I took page 93 the stage I can
07:29
write a three the five probably I got we
07:33
should be five not the root these seven
07:39
guys should be careful to not lose my
07:42
bishop on g5 so I don't know how to play
07:50
this yeah this is not good
07:56
before we shall be to all right
08:04
should go back I should play a little
08:06
faster but this is of course much force
08:09
for me maybe not much worse spot of
08:12
coram for sure worse
08:15
yeah I should exchange this it was from
08:19
the eighth probably and then I believe
08:23
on okay now I connect c4 and Ricky
08:27
Vaughn for this sort of a disrupt one OK
08:34
ROCK d7i talking f1 or Bishop III maybe
08:41
I don't know okay root B seven he has to
08:48
play or kinky things in b6 f3 so root
08:51
this seven protein the roti six
08:56
let's go we should be three it could
08:59
take this nut will get around that
09:06
should I go h4 now Bishop c5 let's just
09:14
put the bishop here he cannot really
09:18
push here because they didn't weaken
09:20
himself
09:21
so it's interesting he exchanged the
09:26
bishop he wants so I might take and go
09:31
f3 took the e7 yeah okay
09:40
III i th and rookies are 92 so I got at
09:46
least $7 my mr. t7 mr. probably and
09:53
mature so king of to fight sector okay
10:04
let's give a check and take this King
10:07
he's off on time so I should be careful
10:12
give me three before is now it's
10:19
unpleasant but it was he got a four so
10:24
95 yeah this is bad
10:33
94 king of still probably go c5 now okay
10:48
b5 to expand takes not sure what GD 3
10:57
okay let's see takes takes I'm tricky 96
11:02
so he has to eat for and here I
11:05
could go h3 so let's say King 93 check
11:15
Kingi 3ok 96 because a six I'd 197 okay
11:31
this is true okay was a good save I
11:37
think I must worse
11:38
so it's one and a half half because it
11:40
played once before so okay it goes
11:45
before it it changes the line slightly
11:48
five okay because we shall be five a-six
11:54
night of six he goes 43 okay let's go me
12:00
555 let's see what you got here
12:07
six goes for Bishop g5 so now if I go h6
12:13
is it gonna take
12:15
no okay
12:19
let's copy should be see it to create -
12:28
how should I play this
12:32
should I go ninety-seven and see what
12:35
happens
12:35
the idle connected Sun let's see if it
12:38
opens up the file it's interesting I got
12:44
my teach for what okay
12:50
in this sermon cancel Queen she ate okay
12:55
let's go here it was carnage five I got
12:58
in b7s plate a strange way okay now I go
13:06
up in g8 by 125 so probably is going to
13:14
play g3 Quinn chief 522 and okay it's
13:24
interesting position I cannot say with
13:25
better I have a very solid center so I'm
13:30
not sure if I'm verse 25
13:35
okay I'm to go a five actually so just
13:40
let's clear day Bishop jobs here if he
13:43
wants to take or not 9 f3 I go finish
13:48
five I think
13:50
finish five some tactics may be so 26
13:55
just bank before Queenie forest idea
13:58
always but he has to go differ anyway I
14:02
think no okay okay so once eg for
14:06
negative three and I could suck the
14:13
Queen there what a natural he's good
14:22
takes things c6 Queenie to I'm sure see
14:31
65.5 not sure what to do here should I
14:43
go
14:44
stay for I mean this amount of time here
14:54
[Music]
14:56
at that stage I might suck the Queen I
15:03
don't know they just took just to come
15:10
before okay
15:15
Quincy five now I am I came down on time
15:20
what okay if I managed to get a good
15:22
position that stage before it's going to
15:35
blend up see one Queen before according
15:39
to take is probably ninety four okay so
15:48
I should go see five but now if you suck
15:51
something on e6 probably takes twenty
15:59
four of six and that is made
16:01
yeah okay or even take here yeah and if
16:12
I go to see eight I don't have time yeah
16:17
I go through one so I should go 22 I'm
16:24
very long time
16:29
so let's say Lucas is 7 because look if
16:35
- probably over here to page 7
16:41
ok descendants mate ok yeah this was a
16:44
bad game by me I mean I had a good
16:47
position but ok let's see if or it goes
16:51
night of 6 I will take all right let's
16:58
go Bishop d3 and so would you want let's
17:08
see what he's going to do
17:10
it's playing very fast so it should be a
17:13
bit faster I think so let's see 93 97
17:20
night of 3 you cannot go c5 okay you
17:23
don't spread c4 Knight d4 d5 ok we'll
17:28
play this should play this so it's going
17:35
to take us to be shot so I have space
17:38
advantage so we will see you will see
17:41
[Music]
17:44
Knight c3 it's going to take and one
17:51
night p6 mean we shall be four maybe
18:04
Scottie three takes I take on before
18:08
because we shall be five then I have
18:11
achieved worth if it goes 96 then I take
18:15
and Knight c3 or take and t6 maybe
18:21
probably that works let's see if it goes
18:26
Bishop a5 or maybe it was just make
18:29
these six Alexa chord and play against
18:32
those phones okay so what can I do here
18:38
I need a strong move so write C 3 P 4
18:47
but are able to block it 94
18:54
yeah this is strange
18:57
I mean Portugal Bishop g5 before we
19:10
shall define at 66 takes 25 finish 8th
19:20
okay let's put this guy here for now
19:25
[Music]
19:26
maybe he comes to b6 or something Bishop
19:33
g5 is very strong thread so he has to
19:35
take he cannot race though so let's go
19:39
TC okay so we up to 550 X on f3
19:46
Quincy 1 let's do it not
19:55
with glute but you should've 321 of six
20:01
G of three then I have those two pounds
20:05
which is very strong we will say now we
20:10
also calculate and if coin see one
20:15
Bishop six I take I'm going to see 420
20:17
french g3 I mean it's fine I don't know
20:21
with better but it is fine proudly so
20:27
let's see it because f6 then I go Bishop
20:32
which rattles I have time advantage here
20:35
so he takes Queen c1 because of six so
20:42
now which ones that later should take
20:44
this fine to context okay
20:48
I miss this one so kind of in c4 26:56
20:57
Queen a fourth okay I should take Queen
21:06
d2 421 from the Queen Devon okay wait
21:16
this is Queen eight five videos let's
21:19
see can I bring anything to the game
21:25
maybe three divine let's go
21:35
[Music]
21:39
seven and twenty five let's see how he's
21:45
going to play this you have 37 so here
21:48
if it's hard to play I have to play b3
21:53
somewhere Cooney for Quincy six okay
22:06
let's go peace Regis to start with
22:11
cookie 655 okay six
22:19
check okay I take the real kind sweet
22:39
okay but once I quit very good there so
22:42
it's not about time witches I think we
22:45
should be five in seven was Daniels so
22:49
[Music]
22:50
before I go if I if I say anything might
22:56
have three nights these things should be
22:58
five
22:59
let's go a six but I have to change
23:03
something here let's put these things so
23:09
c3 g6 let's play this way Castle I mean
23:17
I could could be five I thought when I
23:21
teach five let's go be 57 first start
23:28
and create I might try some 94 so if K
23:40
night if
23:41
exchange a lot of pieces and I'm not
23:46
sure let's go for it
23:47
I don't know so let's say we shove this
23:51
793 queen of 397 I'm going to try to
23:56
push a 5 like so I don't think ok taste
24:02
this way
24:02
I'd like to under cut Bishop III I mean
24:13
it's very hard to say push-ups the six
24:21
take only five ninety 44 you know this
24:31
is not good Alki play you should be fine
24:40
just go say for you shop c6 it takes and
24:48
97 d4 yeah this is bad the plunger
24:56
twirly so Knight g4 thanks because it's
25:10
Trina 96 this is bad now this is lost I
25:25
cannot do anything here yeah the ship
25:33
chief arrived now this was a very bad
25:37
game which sinks I should not play e5
25:44
then maybe I should switch to Sicilian
25:50
probably
25:53
the server was a five yeah
26:06
in c6 probably has a six here or Bishop
26:12
g5 and everything's on us yeah okay this
26:19
was a bad game by plundered and sadly
26:21
but it's fine
26:23
so he's going to change under Kenya so
26:27
we go Knight c3
26:30
let's go Knight c3 he's sinking because
26:37
a6 so night of 3 + T 6 let's go
26:44
g3 ninth of six Bishop g2 let's see how
26:52
it's going to play okay which three
26:59
takes and if I play you should detail
27:04
because g6 let's connect it - I'm trying
27:12
to play c3 d4 so let's say C 39523 31
27:30
probably not
27:32
five Queen III see forward but I talking
27:37
it's very bad like I put up III cancel
27:43
it before it's interesting
27:48
let's see see 44 Queenie 353 let's see
27:59
if it goes defined it looks very
28:03
dangerous but you might play it because
28:06
might not have other choice
28:09
they just goes castle
28:12
so if form is I don't see it
28:18
so he's we going to be late eNOS okay
28:22
this is 34 white I don't see why it
28:25
should be bad for me probably 100
28:29
something because you're like 4.0 so
28:33
let's see I have to convert this so 95
28:39
t3 and p5 I just take take group tanks
28:47
they both we need five I mean I could
28:52
take I got these three yeah let's just
28:57
do it
28:58
you might talk to me for that we need
29:01
for Quincy for maybe hey thanks if it
29:08
takes e5 probably goes would be to
29:13
thanking a fanmeeting Queen a for I
29:17
missed okay miss Queenie for again okay
29:24
this is me that's called the father and
29:32
Queenie for you create
29:38
the five let's see if we can make things
29:43
complicated a little bit chief or let's
29:56
go in III microphone 95 or just push the
30:04
point one eight five I might cut Bishop
30:09
g5 + g5 attacking like that so maybe he
30:13
has to keep the night to DA so how can i
30:20
play this book see 193 okay those 95 so
30:36
94 alright I will go look at one Queen
30:44
can I go can be six Quincy to 9th of six
30:48
six takes they just goes this way in b7
30:56
look the eighth night c5 this is a piece
31:04
okay I should take this way this Mikey
31:10
Michael for so I should be careful night
31:16
if I finish okay let's go queenie 496 it
31:29
gets activated here
31:36
yeah so what can I do here I don't have
31:41
move 3 ok draw I think my had winning
32:15
position now he is very fast in this
32:18
side so ok so if I have to change my
32:23
mind so let's go see fine it's good
32:27
timing off maybe goes g3
32:33
so 96 might have 6 to 5 he wants to go
32:46
Kings Indian attack which I don't think
32:48
is dangerous I don't know ok this way so
32:59
if I go t4 because like to show before
33:02
and get this set up properly and not
33:11
sure what to do here exactly
33:14
I mean Queen c7
33:27
okay let's see if it takes
33:37
it could take I'm gonna show before but
33:41
then Queen age five should marry okay 93
33:50
96 95 28 this is very dangerous very
34:01
dangerous be sure before you should be
34:06
six okay if I could get away with this
34:14
then I'm fine
34:17
27 let's page six
34:27
I might go long castle at some point
34:34
because of FG 5 so we will see yeah I
34:43
should I mean let's go home castle who
34:51
cares
34:52
let's go home castle and g5 it is not
35:01
worth it to not play this here my
35:11
quickly for for sure yes so let's go 5
35:21
ok 95
35:29
hmm should I turn 45 no I should go for
35:36
it you should go for it
35:40
so if I take things we shall be three or
35:44
four before yeah that's a four well
36:05
maybe just calculate and take on t8 with
36:07
not sure they create yeah it feels like
36:17
I'm very slow because of Michelin g510
36:20
he plays here which stinks she stinks I
36:36
should be careful mrs. check King v8
36:43
right before the thing is miss playing
36:46
it very badly I don't know like Jake's
36:51
takes yeah and should take so let's see
37:08
let's see
37:09
I should be fast
37:20
[Music]
37:21
this was before 95 yeah this is losing
37:40
I have no trying of again I'm not versed
37:44
here let's see ok blunder this route
38:00
okay okay I knew that people to anger
38:10
because it was only thing in each one so
38:14
okay 43 I think is the result
38:18
at least I managed to bring my black in
38:21
now so they before let's go ahead should
38:29
be three actually I got a good position
38:32
look him one night f3 I mean before
38:41
might be 45 X takes I cut this position
38:48
not sure how is this assessment okay dot
38:51
d5 so he wants to make c3 this is a big
39:02
deal that I've I could see that but we
39:05
should use it
39:07
because f6 now right for justice not
39:20
sure what to do here
39:25
51 9320 English 94 so let's see look see
39:45
I thought we should be stolen maybe 97
39:50
28 t8 rookie 7 fish of f3 f3 that is
39:59
good
40:00
that one's good 54 let's eat before
40:09
okay miss before it is it good like we
40:17
need for yesterday Queen I think I'm
40:23
using a lot of time but it should be
40:26
worse sit here okay hit probably okay
40:36
Ruby hey I think yeah 93 he takes I take
40:42
let's just all agree one would be five
40:49
group c4 he's going to take on pizza
40:54
probably the shoot
40:59
between here yes if he has to take
41:02
because if 5p3 not sure I'm not sure
41:10
okay he goes a fight
41:14
III okay so Kim G - if one should I go
41:28
for a vein rupesh 5h4
41:30
yeah I took a cookie for kinky - project
41:40
was not a good idea to change for looks
41:45
it you okay now he plays for me but I
41:55
will give him this is fine point
41:58
probably okay he ate that this is my
42:18
piss place is bad near should not lose
42:19
still but okay to be fine
42:33
eat okay I will donate before he has to
42:44
risk here I think okay 95 once the Queen
42:55
is fine
42:56
[Music]
42:57
gingy - okay six so now he has to give
43:06
me temple before me yeah I'm very slow

43:30
was like me right
43:32
what I did to that position is amazing
43:50
yeah this was bad him I had very good
43:54
position but blunders so badly
44:01
okay goes back to d4 so let's go here
44:11
hmm
44:12
exclusive 5 this is 7 micro some c4 idea
44:27

[Music]
50:19
had a good position t1
50:30
you will take again I had a good
50:34
position in the ingame so you'll see he
50:39
has to come up with some new plan might
50:44
just Co native six this game here
50:49
[Music]
50:51
it'll see so night of six-day this one
50:56

51:44
Quincy 294 so I do I have to take and
51:50
take not sure is better in the same game
52:01
okay
52:04
he once you create and everything's
52:08
hanging would be one hopefully I didn't
52:18
longer anything Bishop III my mother
52:25
condo 96 57
52:47
this let's write will be three you go
52:52
for some okay now I got 97 I think I was
52:58
waiting for at least so I think now it's
53:02
fine yeah okay that could be six at
53:11
least I defended to defy the score for
53:13
his night should be draw but today I'm
53:19
pushing and I should not get me that
53:21
this is very important he's pushing here
53:30
at home
53:34
so before g5
53:42
he's not going for okay three probably
53:46
[Music]
53:50
yeah so nice before - to get one okay he
54:01
had to pay money thing it is drawn okay
54:10
okay it's fine
54:12
[Music]
54:14
so let's play c5 Knight of 6
54:25
these six was a 386 I mean just go h6
54:38
so if because each four people knight c6
54:45
if it goes with g1 h 5 maybe not sure
54:53
group 2 it's like press attacked what's
54:56
80386 included not sure who is getting
55:02
that manager in the cresset IP they take
55:09
on each five I think yeah so takes we
55:17
should be five let's scope might be six
55:21
here he doesn't have might be five so
55:26
maybe I'm having the advantage stir
55:31
those that we should be too I guess and
55:37
might have six you want H five a g6
55:44
I mean rook c8 okay it goes on Castle we
55:59
think it will play on console probably
56:07
because clean f2 is very risky move
56:10
okay just cause we should is repack
56:14
Queen c7 long castle maybe he's having
56:19
another plan okay he has to go Castle
56:28
yeah so it should be 70 takes I could
56:33
play the game
56:35

56:41
we don't know what to do here yeah
56:46
that's copy 5 he goes for yeah and night
56:59
eight five three be to make sticks be
57:03
should be for to page seven two two five
57:08
I have to play slicing but he has is
57:17
your position yes is your position for
57:23
short so does King okay he just takes so
57:31
now I have some counter play maybe is
57:36
before then I have to go okay to seven

66:55
probably goes d4 blowing castle once not
67:07

67:09
so thanks yeah probably nighter 493 but
67:14
Bishop g4 this is not very bad let's say
67:25
93 Bishop c4 will go for the endgame
67:32
should I go for the ingame h5 this is
67:35
the picture okay postage for me okay so
67:49
we should with three Queen f3 and my h5
67:53
phone is rage so five was bad no problem
68:02
we don't make sure though let's take 36
68:08
trying to play root of 6 and 6 here this
68:28
is my only idea so I have to play it I
68:31
have a good points on center but is it
68:35
enough I'm not sure if you let's say
68:40
brutish 195 31 953 cookies 7 ok maybe I
68:54
have to go looking 196 so okay the bus
68:59
route t1 look of war King give one to
69:06
give three 9 f3 loop t3 I don't like
69:10
that yeah let's go look for and look f3
69:16
Knight g4 9 th five look at five I have
69:24
so I think it blundered something here
69:28
way too good 5 he wants route before but
69:32
okay 54
69:38
fifty-five shogunate c6 okay we can fix
69:48
96 right blundering something you know
69:52
rocket for okay before this is not to
69:58
lose on time okay he blundered okay your
70:07
back stretch so now I think there are
70:11
six week saying so let's go let's go
70:25
okay let's call it four I mean let's
70:34
connect c3 I'm getting outplayed there
70:36
so 93 Bishop c4 let's play this way t3
70:44
okay probably pro practice I don't know
70:48
[Music]
70:50
so let's see okay they go negative three
70:55
is done
70:57
95 we shot this stick so I go okay this
71:02
one cancel we shove these six
71:09
okay let's Bishop e7 so I take yeah
71:14
Queen f3 so let's go h3 we should be 651
71:24
I think like this
71:30
like it better here but I'm not sure
71:31
what a but I have to play it precisely
71:34
because he has two bishops so can i
71:39
donate see 555 95 it's possible I think
71:51
95 we see it
71:54
well that Scobie should be three trying
71:58
to take on a 71
72:02
so because Queen c7
72:05
we shall be 428 okay so we should be 595
72:21
Vagos 97 54 we should have 6 okay it is
72:31
very messy position I'm not sure watch
72:33
my mouth so let's call native for
72:39
because we should t5 I got 23 okay got
72:47
c5 s coffee shops d3 now I should attack
72:52
now my pieces are in a very good place
72:55
so you should have 894 should be 5
73:07
Knight g5 okay he goes have 6 so that's
73:17
cool like before this is a good move so
73:22
now once crazy c6
73:25
so let's go to the teacher what can go
73:31
wrong
73:32
look v1 so Quincy seven ago
73:40
Quinn g3 and my g6 no no okay 23 let's
73:51
see Quincy six he got Knight of 6 we
73:55
have 6 56 okay now it's not easy to
74:00
defend this exponent sure maybe g5 he
74:03
has to blame but that looks very risky
74:08
he 596 mmm so I'm threatening Knight of
74:13
6 and because 96 ith okay late night of
74:23
6 of these things now this is wrong
74:29
yeah this is meaning this is beneath so
74:37
let's say Queen c7 the screening for I
74:43
might take here
74:46
let's not chop this okay tonight night
74:51
is 5 this is we need shop g7 okay it
75:05
takes on d1 it's fine
75:09
right of 692 795
75:18
let's try 94
75:26
oh sure okay look these six everything
75:31
is on the tag so this is shalini yeah
75:35
this is very nice so yeah so I guess
75:45
you're seven I have 600 so one way is
75:50
over
75:51
what okay before it goes 94 96 yeah
75:57
because III cancel I go c5 I mean that's
76:08
good t5 it takes so I will take and I
76:19
don't think it's the point and go h6
76:25
this is a very solid position so should
76:31
I take not sure so I have to play fast
76:35
this is the important so Bishop with 496
76:42
Michael pointed to an technology six at
76:46
some point so nice it was g4 okay we
76:53
shall be 6 plus we should see 28 Luca g5
77:03
I think ok how can i play it's connected
77:17
suddenly if we cook
77:21
this is really the negative rate might
77:26
go Bishop III it wasn't even so he wants
77:37
to five if I look in of 65 so here like
77:51
she says so if because Knight f4 I take
77:55
on before of course and if he goes okay
77:59
goes Bishop d2 winner six g5 let's
78:08
develop this Bishop I gave him a 4
78:14
give him a 4 ok he's attacking this
78:35
everything so let's connect a faith in
78:51
each work
78:57
gee five push-ups e7 Bishop a4 takes
79:10
things
79:10
yeah sure okay yeah so for a hit finish
79:20
five takes takes Knight d5 stuff he
79:30
takes angle Queen and he takes ankle 95
79:36
but then opens up a pitch shot so he
79:41
probably going to take a look when Jesus
79:43
no okay
79:47
native son should take right okay yeah
79:59
this is not good communicate mated me
80:12
good this was
80:19
I understood meted his attacks okay this
80:23
is the last game okay let's go
80:29
I don't know before let's see what is
80:37
going to play 96 no okay let's play this
80:54
9250
80:58
[Music]
81:02
is read cost castle
81:10
so let's go d4 will collect c8 would be
81:23
one country should keep up this time so
81:27
this is important this is not a bad
81:30
position right Knight c3 we should
81:38
before we cut so H four okay once
81:51
negative four what a return of Bishop d2
81:58
[Music]
82:00
which five 94-94 Bishop differently for
82:04
X amount X takes okay
82:12
nice hanging at the end of the line now
82:15
so six I go to d5 so we shopped III got
82:25
94 let's go indeed show ok now I mean if
82:41
595 I mean let's go before okay now you
82:48
got 94 threat okay let's go for it we
82:59
don't have time 95 23 takes takes takes
83:08
95 55 nights before you should fall okay
83:13
Queen takes Queen T 338 let's cook when
83:35
it's rain
83:36
so now we go doing everything night you
83:40
fall you got right each for we should be
83:50
six look see - okay
83:55
[Music]
83:56
93 94 look
84:07
before my missed night before 195
84:13
I got 95 okay yeah of course I got 95 so
84:22
lowish should not be that bad I'm
84:24
non-threatening without six so probably
84:28
he has to go back to e5 now I got up one
84:32
time so let's go 95 if three it goes
84:45
might be five probably and okay
84:53
king of to have fun so now I got b3 and
85:08
93 so I will tow ready t-one we should
85:13
be to put detail f4 okay I got some five
85:20
ideas so put this vide twenty-five times
85:31
better here okay through this six seater
85:46
3294
85:48
let's see your chief five which 8h five
86:04
okay
86:09
24 and Nate okay I think this was the
86:15
last game right
86:18
is it finished or not okay
86:24
Bucky yes thank you yeah okay I think
86:34
going to match it was 5050 I don't think
86:37
I'm most favored or I don't think he was
86:39
favorite so it was 50/50 but yeah and
86:42
also you can see my results it's very
86:45
close so it should be a little bit lucky
86:48
and it was a strange that if this in
86:51
this time code in this state not that be
86:54
very very less times he was the boss it
86:57
was the guy flagging and I had been in
87:00
position I thought if you need other way
87:03
but yeah okay
87:10
okay it was it is it was not real big
87:13
because of course it is three minute and
87:16
opening is important but not as much of
87:19
course I saw some lines but not much of
87:22
course so like normal preparation I
87:26
prefer classical okay are you preparing
87:29
not supporting for the masters yes yes
87:34
of course it's a very great tournament
87:36
and it is very generous my records that
87:40
he did this tournament because it's very
87:44
good for fans and players and yeah so
87:48
the public wants to know how many hours
87:49
do you prepare to your study chess per
87:52
day okay it's depends on a day but the
87:58
only thing I think about is chess of
88:00
course it's not anything else maybe the
88:05
whole day okay that's why now you are
88:08
beating the world champion actually okay
88:15
how he's working the lockdown good year
88:23
with the quarantine okay it's not of
88:28
course it it is not easy but it is not
88:30
our choice it is thing that happens yeah
88:33
but luckily for for this canteen we got
88:35
the Magnus yeah yeah but change a lot
88:39
you lie for you spend like your time in
88:41
your computer study chest like it
88:44
changed it changed a bit but not much
88:46
of course the richest players are for
88:50
games computer a lot but yeah of course
88:52
it changed a bit yeah okay last question
88:56
what about the mangas Carson
88:58
Invitational do you think like what are
89:00
your chances over there do you think
89:01
that you can beat many grandmasters many
89:04
of them played alone I played with them
89:07
already a lot we had some beans we had
89:09
some news but because of its rapids of
89:12
course I have some chances but of course
89:15
it's not much because I am the last seat
89:18
yeah
89:19
I am not the favorite of course well I
89:23
don't know after this much who knows
89:29
thank you for in the relief cup thank
89:34
you
