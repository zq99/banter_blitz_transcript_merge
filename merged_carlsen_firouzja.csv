id,time,label,comment
48,00:48,carlsen,okay so here we go ready for the final
53,00:53,firouzja,yes yes now we are playing okay let's
55,00:55,carlsen,and yeah I get white in the first game
101,01:01,carlsen,gonna go d4 Knight f3 well it just goes
108,01:08,carlsen,for Queens gambit I expected something
109,01:09,firouzja,let's do this let's go bishop b4
112,01:12,carlsen,something something sharper the Ragozin
114,01:14,firouzja,let's see what you got here e d
115,01:15,carlsen,"of of all things now let me take, let's"
117,01:17,firouzja,"so we go castle, e3 we go bishop f5 or"
119,01:19,carlsen,see what he's got in mind
122,01:22,carlsen,he castles
123,01:23,firouzja,h6 maybe then bishop f5 so we go
126,01:26,carlsen,"hmm,yeah, I'm going to go e3, h6"
129,01:29,firouzja,Bishop f5 he goes probably Queen b3 here
130,01:30,carlsen,bishop h4 he is probably gonna go bishop
132,01:32,carlsen,f5 okay let me try a queen
133,01:33,firouzja,so we take and yeah ihe takes so now we
136,01:36,carlsen,b3 he takes it
140,01:40,carlsen,Queen c3 I guess
140,01:40,firouzja,could call g5 I think? we bishop g3 knight b4 if
143,01:43,carlsen,oh yeah that's right
148,01:48,carlsen,g5 immediately it's actually good I
150,01:50,firouzja,he takes on c7 knight c6 is fine so
151,01:51,carlsen,forgot about that
152,01:52,firouzja,let's see what he comes up with
155,01:55,carlsen,no clue what to do here but I didn't
155,01:55,firouzja,okay so he goes Queen a3 umm let's see what
200,02:00,carlsen,feel too keen on taking that pawn on c7 okay
203,02:03,firouzja,can I do
204,02:04,carlsen,I should do something else in the next
206,02:06,carlsen,game cuz I don't want to don't want to
207,02:07,firouzja,um
208,02:08,carlsen,run into his preparation but at least
211,02:11,carlsen,he's thinking now so I'm assuming else he has
211,02:11,firouzja,let's go knight c6 cannot be bad move
214,02:14,carlsen,bunch of good options here like h5 also
217,02:17,carlsen,looked good so now I guess Bishop b5
218,02:18,firouzja,okay bishop b5 so I could go knight e7 or
222,02:22,carlsen,suspect I want to take that next if
223,02:23,firouzja,I could go a5 then he has to take I
224,02:24,carlsen,given a chance
228,02:28,carlsen,if knight c6 maybe I'll go Knight d2 if
228,02:28,firouzja,take rook c1 okay let's just go knight e7
232,02:32,carlsen,he takes King d2 - I think my King is
232,02:32,firouzja,he goes knight d2 I could take on d2 and go
234,02:34,carlsen,more or less fine in the center and if
237,02:37,carlsen,Knight g3 hg at least I got a normal
239,02:39,firouzja,c6 or I could play c6 at first if you want to take
240,02:40,carlsen,position
243,02:43,carlsen,and I could always claim umm that umm I can okay
247,02:47,firouzja,then it's fine
249,02:49,firouzja,probably he should go back with Bishop
251,02:51,carlsen,so that's a clever move huh uh
253,02:53,firouzja,so I don't know where probably to d3 or d2
256,02:56,carlsen,yeah bishop d3 probably takes on d2 - I'm
258,02:58,firouzja,"I am not sure, d3, okay so he wants to"
301,03:01,carlsen,gonna do that anyway
302,03:02,firouzja,attack on
303,03:03,firouzja,"the h-file I guess, so"
306,03:06,carlsen,the thing is if he if he went like
309,03:09,carlsen,Knight d2 King d2 - I would have gone
309,03:09,firouzja,should I go h5? h4? knight g3? fg3? ok I will take
312,03:12,carlsen,Bishop e2 - and if he had would have gone Knight g3
315,03:15,carlsen,hg c6 then I would probably I wanted to
319,03:19,carlsen,trade the bishops
321,03:21,firouzja,"take and go queen a5 check, he goes King c2"
323,03:23,carlsen,ummm the difference being something about the
326,03:26,carlsen,dark squares no sorry the light squares
329,03:29,carlsen,on the on the kingside with with the h
330,03:30,firouzja,- okay let's give a check ok he goes king e2
334,03:34,carlsen,file opened compared to to this where my
336,03:36,carlsen,King is in the center now I think I'm
338,03:38,carlsen,doing fine I'm intending h4 pretty soon
339,03:39,firouzja,- let's push f5 I am down on time a
342,03:42,carlsen,and my King is perfectly safe
346,03:46,carlsen,he goes for f5 but seems bit overzealous
346,03:46,firouzja,little bit but it's not a big deal to
351,03:51,firouzja,"Rook e8, h4 I go g4 I think, and f3 rook"
352,03:52,carlsen,to me I go h4 he goes g4 maybe I
358,03:58,carlsen,don't achieve that much so I could go g4 as
402,04:02,carlsen,well
404,04:04,carlsen,if he goes F G maybe I'll go h4
406,04:06,firouzja,f6 bishop f5 knight g6 if he takes knight f4 okay
411,04:11,carlsen,yeah I'm just going to do that
414,04:14,firouzja,so what should I do here um okay
417,04:17,carlsen,no reason to be scared
421,04:21,carlsen,f4 as well
423,04:23,firouzja,rook f6 bishop f5 rook f7
424,04:24,carlsen,think I'm gonna go h4
429,04:29,carlsen,and my queen is protecting my king very
430,04:30,firouzja,"okay, lets go rook f6"
433,04:33,firouzja,bishop f5 rook f7 or knight g6 I got f4 takes...
434,04:34,carlsen,well so this move I don't like for him now
437,04:37,carlsen,I get Bishop e5 with tempo
438,04:38,firouzja,this is very complicated but I should go
439,04:39,carlsen,I'm going h4 next oh and I just
441,04:41,firouzja,for it because if he takes under f6 knight f4!
443,04:43,carlsen,missed this okay
446,04:46,carlsen,yeah that's why I never
449,04:49,carlsen,underestimates Alireza so he's
449,04:49,firouzja,"okay now it could take, this is very"
451,04:51,carlsen,devilishly tricky okay so he takes Hg
455,04:55,firouzja,dangerous rook h5 and I should go
457,04:57,carlsen,rook h5 I think I'm still doing
500,05:00,carlsen,pretty well I think he should probably
503,05:03,carlsen,have gone
503,05:03,carlsen,Rook e5 then knight e5 because then my
503,05:03,firouzja,for something my queen b4 and now I am down on
505,05:05,carlsen,queen would have been kicked away at the
506,05:06,firouzja,time that is the worst thing I'm
509,05:09,firouzja,threatening Queen f4 maybe but he might
511,05:11,carlsen,very least so I can go rook h1
513,05:13,firouzja,exchange the Queens by queen c3 I cannot
516,05:16,carlsen,yeah I probably don't have a whole lot
518,05:18,firouzja,"be worst here, ok let's go queen f4 now"
519,05:19,carlsen,hear still so okay let me just go b3
520,05:20,carlsen,protect my stuff
523,05:23,carlsen,Queen f4
524,05:24,firouzja,he's worse but because rook f5 queen g4 so he
526,05:26,carlsen,probably a very good move which I completely
529,05:29,carlsen,missed
529,05:29,firouzja,has to go Queen c3 and he is still
531,05:31,carlsen,huh
532,05:32,firouzja,hanging there um d4 Queen c4 so I
535,05:35,carlsen,I can not go Rook g4 because queen g4
537,05:37,firouzja,should take on g5 Queen g4 and it is not clear
540,05:40,carlsen,that's the that's the main issue here I
543,05:43,carlsen,can't go queen d4 no I can't go Queen
546,05:46,carlsen,d4 maybe I have Queen f5 actually
546,05:46,firouzja,okay okay we could do this I missed okay
551,05:51,firouzja,okay I have queen g5 now he blundered the rook
554,05:54,carlsen,"ah, he takes that rook"
554,05:54,firouzja,now it's lost
555,05:55,firouzja,okay he wants to flag me here rook e8 rook e4
556,05:56,carlsen,okay I'm gonna lose hoping for f4
601,06:01,carlsen,But I think he's just got way too
605,06:05,carlsen,much time here but I'm gonna try and
605,06:05,firouzja,king g7 yeah this is lost queen b7 yeah the
609,06:09,carlsen,flag him of course
612,06:12,carlsen,no chance here
615,06:15,carlsen,d3 rook d7 and I'm barely up on time
617,06:17,firouzja,I think I could win this
626,06:26,carlsen,and see if I can get him to stalemate
627,06:27,firouzja,I don't know why he's playing on
628,06:28,firouzja,"okay, this is mate"
639,06:39,carlsen,me here I'm assuming there's no chance
642,06:42,carlsen,okay yeah no chance yeah this is gonna
642,06:42,firouzja,okay he blundered queen f4
645,06:45,firouzja,which was very tricky of course it's not
647,06:47,firouzja,easy but he had Queen c3 so okay
648,06:48,carlsen,be tough rook f6!
651,06:51,firouzja,first name was good
652,06:52,carlsen,yeah I should have should have just
652,06:52,firouzja,so let's go if for those 95 okay place
655,06:55,carlsen,assumed he was going to to try and trick
658,06:58,carlsen,me they're not just believe that he
660,06:60,firouzja,down looking because g6 so I mean I have
701,07:01,carlsen,made a poor move he's too good for that
705,07:05,carlsen,okay so I'm going for the Alekhine
709,07:09,firouzja,a lot of option here should be to Castle
710,07:10,carlsen,trying once again to now well at least
714,07:14,firouzja,let's go see three let's play it slow
716,07:16,carlsen,in this game see if I can get a time
718,07:18,carlsen,advantage hold on
719,07:19,firouzja,how can i play this should've three if
720,07:20,carlsen,she's allowing c5 so I guess I should
723,07:23,carlsen,just go for that
726,07:26,carlsen,I think he's played to passively him
727,07:27,firouzja,it takes twenty four so it was 96
730,07:30,carlsen,probably CD Queen d4 I got 96 pcs six
740,07:40,carlsen,should have enough fix T of T is to
741,07:41,firouzja,I just take and go Quincy for orphanage
743,07:43,carlsen,compensate for the slightly worse
745,07:45,carlsen,structure if you've done Queenie five
745,07:45,firouzja,horrible finish for because if v if v is
747,07:47,carlsen,quindi five woulda got Knight d5 that I
751,07:51,carlsen,would have been perfectly fine um yeah
751,07:51,firouzja,the move proudly and takes on a five but
755,07:55,carlsen,you fine I guess
755,07:55,firouzja,it is much it should not be a big deal
757,07:57,carlsen,you
758,07:58,firouzja,like I took page 93 the stage I can
803,08:03,carlsen,bismuth Bishop g4 o f6 Bishop h6 yeah so
805,08:05,firouzja,write a three the five probably I got we
809,08:09,carlsen,you should just do this instead Bishop
809,08:09,firouzja,should be five not the root these seven
815,08:15,carlsen,g5 clever routine AIDS
815,08:15,firouzja,guys should be careful to not lose my
818,08:18,firouzja,bishop on g5 so I don't know how to play
821,08:21,carlsen,night c4i garbage base 6 I'm not worried
824,08:24,carlsen,about that
826,08:26,carlsen,you
826,08:26,firouzja,this yeah this is not good
832,08:32,firouzja,before we shall be to all right
836,08:36,carlsen,IOH 6:45 cd5 take which would be 6 takes
840,08:40,firouzja,should go back I should play a little
841,08:41,carlsen,takes and then I take on any two should
842,08:42,firouzja,faster but this is of course much force
844,08:44,carlsen,be it should be perfectly fine for me
845,08:45,firouzja,for me maybe not much worse spot of
848,08:48,carlsen,now I think I have got a 6 and then you
848,08:48,firouzja,coram for sure worse
851,08:51,firouzja,yeah I should exchange this it was from
853,08:53,carlsen,for take it cool bishops III but don't
855,08:55,firouzja,the eighth probably and then I believe
859,08:59,firouzja,on okay now I connect c4 and Ricky
901,09:01,carlsen,think that really really works let me
903,09:03,carlsen,just centralize the King rook the AIDS
903,09:03,firouzja,Vaughn for this sort of a disrupt one OK
909,09:09,carlsen,so he wants to go a 95 now
910,09:10,firouzja,ROCK d7i talking f1 or Bishop III maybe
917,09:17,firouzja,I don't know okay root B seven he has to
919,09:19,carlsen,[Music]
921,09:21,carlsen,it's coming
924,09:24,firouzja,play or kinky things in b6 f3 so root
925,09:25,carlsen,what should I do about that
927,09:27,firouzja,this seven protein the roti six
929,09:29,carlsen,okay try Ricky 695 47
932,09:32,firouzja,let's go we should be three it could
935,09:35,firouzja,take this nut will get around that
938,09:38,carlsen,he goes we should be three guys 47 gypsy
942,09:42,firouzja,should I go h4 now Bishop c5 let's just
944,09:44,carlsen,five maybe g5 trying to expand okay I'm
950,09:50,firouzja,put the bishop here he cannot really
954,09:54,firouzja,push here because they didn't weaken
956,09:56,firouzja,himself
957,09:57,firouzja,so it's interesting he exchanged the
1002,10:02,firouzja,bishop he wants so I might take and go
1003,10:03,carlsen,hesitating a bit too much now before I'm
1007,10:07,firouzja,f3 took the e7 yeah okay
1016,10:16,firouzja,III i th and rookies are 92 so I got at
1017,10:17,carlsen,probably going to rugby Salmond okay so
1021,10:21,carlsen,he goes for this one okay so I'll just
1022,10:22,firouzja,least $7 my mr. t7 mr. probably and
1029,10:29,firouzja,mature so king of to fight sector okay
1030,10:30,carlsen,go for King e7 I'm not loving the the
1036,10:36,carlsen,isolated pawn here but okay when I get
1040,10:40,carlsen,the chance I think I'm gonna I'm gonna
1040,10:40,firouzja,let's give a check and take this King
1043,10:43,carlsen,escape so I miss 95 but I don't think it
1043,10:43,firouzja,he's off on time so I should be careful
1046,10:46,carlsen,was a big deal
1048,10:48,carlsen,okay Knight of 6 I'm not just gonna try
1048,10:48,firouzja,give me three before is now it's
1050,10:50,carlsen,and try and make a Drona g5 push King d5
1055,10:55,firouzja,unpleasant but it was he got a four so
1056,10:56,carlsen,King D 3 I'm going f4 probably a little
1060,10:60,firouzja,95 yeah this is bad
1100,11:00,carlsen,bit better
1102,11:02,carlsen,Knight most I got I got a 4 followed by
1106,11:06,carlsen,95 continue to push
1109,11:09,firouzja,94 king of still probably go c5 now okay
1112,11:12,carlsen,can you for
1118,11:18,carlsen,I'm definitely whole lot better now
1120,11:20,carlsen,probably winning this is very annoying
1124,11:24,firouzja,b5 to expand takes not sure what GD 3
1129,11:29,carlsen,though takes a B and that is got 96 is
1133,11:33,firouzja,okay let's see takes takes I'm tricky 96
1136,11:36,carlsen,he really gonna escape on me this is
1138,11:38,firouzja,so he has to eat for and here I
1141,11:41,firouzja,could go h3 so let's say King 93 check
1144,11:44,carlsen,super annoying
1151,11:51,firouzja,Kingi 3ok 96 because a six I'd 197 okay
1200,12:00,carlsen,you can go 96 okay this is just gonna be
1207,12:07,firouzja,this is true okay was a good save I
1213,12:13,carlsen,a draw don't like it I feel like I was I
1213,12:13,firouzja,think I must worse
1214,12:14,firouzja,so it's one and a half half because it
1216,12:16,firouzja,played once before so okay it goes
1221,12:21,carlsen,was doing well in that game and I was
1221,12:21,firouzja,before it it changes the line slightly
1224,12:24,carlsen,probably a bit too hasty and trying to
1224,12:24,firouzja,five okay because we shall be five a-six
1227,12:27,carlsen,convert it you see what he's got in mind
1230,12:30,firouzja,night of six he goes 43 okay let's go me
1234,12:34,carlsen,here
1235,12:35,carlsen,I'll go d3 just try and play normal sort
1236,12:36,firouzja,555 let's see what you got here
1242,12:42,carlsen,of close Spanish position c3 now and
1243,12:43,firouzja,six goes for Bishop g5 so now if I go h6
1249,12:49,carlsen,yeah this is what Shakira did against me
1249,12:49,firouzja,is it gonna take
1251,12:51,carlsen,in the previous match but without the
1251,12:51,firouzja,no okay
1254,12:54,carlsen,pawn and beef island in that game I
1255,12:55,firouzja,let's copy should be see it to create -
1256,12:56,carlsen,think I ended up castling queenside and
1258,12:58,carlsen,my point is now that after he's actually
1302,13:02,carlsen,gonna be five and queenside castling is
1304,13:04,firouzja,how should I play this
1305,13:05,carlsen,less of an option so that should be
1307,13:07,carlsen,favorable for me I don't know if I'm
1308,13:08,firouzja,should I go ninety-seven and see what
1311,13:11,firouzja,happens
1311,13:11,firouzja,the idle connected Sun let's see if it
1313,13:13,carlsen,playing this to accurately Oh 97 that's
1314,13:14,firouzja,opens up the file it's interesting I got
1319,13:19,carlsen,very surprising I guess I'll take one
1320,13:20,firouzja,my teach for what okay
1322,13:22,carlsen,night h4
1325,13:25,carlsen,I don't think that was called for an
1326,13:26,carlsen,all-night g6 I did Queen h5 looks the
1326,13:26,firouzja,in this sermon cancel Queen she ate okay
1331,13:31,carlsen,looks very promising for me yeah Queen
1331,13:31,firouzja,let's go here it was carnage five I got
1334,13:34,firouzja,in b7s plate a strange way okay now I go
1337,13:37,carlsen,h5 now King T 7 yeah this is this is I
1342,13:42,firouzja,up in g8 by 125 so probably is going to
1349,13:49,carlsen,think not very good how to be precise
1350,13:50,firouzja,play g3 Quinn chief 522 and okay it's
1355,13:55,carlsen,though you can use got Queen g5 so
1358,13:58,carlsen,logical option is just to go g3 Queen g5
1360,13:60,firouzja,interesting position I cannot say with
1400,14:00,carlsen,drop the Queen back higher got anything
1401,14:01,firouzja,better I have a very solid center so I'm
1403,14:03,carlsen,better
1404,14:04,carlsen,Phil Knight a5 Queen g5 no I think I'm
1406,14:06,firouzja,not sure if I'm verse 25
1411,14:11,carlsen,just gonna go g3 drop the Queen your
1411,14:11,firouzja,okay I'm to go a five actually so just
1415,14:15,carlsen,tanks I take feel like I still got some
1416,14:16,firouzja,let's clear day Bishop jobs here if he
1418,14:18,carlsen,some pressure mmm
1419,14:19,firouzja,wants to take or not 9 f3 I go finish
1424,14:24,firouzja,five I think
1426,14:26,carlsen,yeah a knight of three may be intending
1426,14:26,firouzja,finish five some tactics may be so 26
1428,14:28,carlsen,d4 Queen g6 she anticipates that yes I'm
1431,14:31,firouzja,just bank before Queenie forest idea
1434,14:34,firouzja,always but he has to go differ anyway I
1438,14:38,firouzja,think no okay okay so once eg for
1441,14:41,carlsen,gonna try and be more clever good D for
1442,14:42,firouzja,negative three and I could suck the
1444,14:44,carlsen,now
1449,14:49,carlsen,I am going out of three and then CD
1449,14:49,firouzja,Queen there what a natural he's good
1453,14:53,carlsen,and then his filter Queen g6 let's check
1458,14:58,carlsen,on B if I was nothing special so
1458,14:58,firouzja,takes things c6 Queenie to I'm sure see
1500,15:00,carlsen,probably easy I gotta go CD was sort of
1505,15:05,carlsen,my backup option then Bishop t-49 of
1507,15:07,firouzja,65.5 not sure what to do here should I
1510,15:10,carlsen,three queen c5 maybe you can you can
1514,15:14,carlsen,make my work technically certainly
1519,15:19,firouzja,go
1520,15:20,firouzja,stay for I mean this amount of time here
1525,15:25,carlsen,thinking a lot now
1530,15:30,firouzja,[Music]
1532,15:32,firouzja,at that stage I might suck the Queen I
1534,15:34,carlsen,sure these are some of the things he's
1536,15:36,carlsen,considering yeah so okay I guess I
1539,15:39,firouzja,don't know they just took just to come
1543,15:43,carlsen,should tank the trip day for a night of
1546,15:46,carlsen,three Queen c5 I don't really see what
1546,15:46,firouzja,before okay
1547,15:47,carlsen,to do though I also been castle or take
1551,15:51,carlsen,the four but then I got a protectee for
1551,15:51,firouzja,Quincy five now I am I came down on time
1554,15:54,carlsen,as well
1556,15:56,carlsen,[Music]
1556,15:56,firouzja,what okay if I managed to get a good
1558,15:58,firouzja,position that stage before it's going to
1602,16:02,carlsen,now I think I'm just Castle fe3 and then
1605,16:05,carlsen,I got a square on I got a square on d4
1609,16:09,carlsen,as well
1610,16:10,carlsen,rusty one coming I think position is not
1611,16:11,firouzja,blend up see one Queen before according
1614,16:14,carlsen,going to be too easy for him to play so
1615,16:15,firouzja,to take is probably ninety four okay so
1618,16:18,carlsen,I take your Knight d4 I guess he's
1624,16:24,firouzja,I should go see five but now if you suck
1625,16:25,carlsen,probably gonna go c5 then I try and kick
1627,16:27,firouzja,something on e6 probably takes twenty
1629,16:29,carlsen,kick his queen with a 3 mm yeah rook if
1635,16:35,carlsen,6 is very tempting
1635,16:35,firouzja,four of six and that is made
1637,16:37,firouzja,yeah okay or even take here yeah and if
1638,16:38,carlsen,CD for Queen G for yes that's very good
1648,16:48,firouzja,I go to see eight I don't have time yeah
1653,16:53,firouzja,I go through one so I should go 22 I'm
1655,16:55,carlsen,it's going to be hard-pressed
1658,16:58,carlsen,defend us especially with so little time
1660,16:60,firouzja,very long time
1700,17:00,carlsen,and he tries to go for some counter play
1703,17:03,carlsen,but don't think it's gonna work out
1705,17:05,firouzja,so let's say Lucas is 7 because look if
1707,17:07,carlsen,could be wrong rook c7 threatens mates
1711,17:11,firouzja,- probably over here to page 7
1712,17:12,carlsen,on two squares
1715,17:15,carlsen,yeah Kingi Taurua Queenie - arica -
1717,17:17,carlsen,that's gonna be game over now this is
1717,17:17,firouzja,ok descendants mate ok yeah this was a
1720,17:20,carlsen,great
1720,17:20,firouzja,bad game by me I mean I had a good
1721,17:21,carlsen,okay even the score very important this
1723,17:23,firouzja,position but ok let's see if or it goes
1727,17:27,carlsen,is gonna be a rough match it's not gonna
1727,17:27,firouzja,night of 6 I will take all right let's
1731,17:31,carlsen,be easy at all so let me try it the
1733,17:33,carlsen,other kin again because I feel like
1734,17:34,carlsen,position I got was pretty good goes with
1734,17:34,firouzja,go Bishop d3 and so would you want let's
1740,17:40,carlsen,the bishop to a different Square this
1742,17:42,carlsen,time
1744,17:44,carlsen,but I'm not convinced by this either I
1744,17:44,firouzja,see what he's going to do
1746,17:46,firouzja,it's playing very fast so it should be a
1749,17:49,firouzja,bit faster I think so let's see 93 97
1752,17:52,carlsen,receive five takes I got night before
1756,17:56,carlsen,okay let me just go 97 play more or less
1756,17:56,firouzja,night of 3 you cannot go c5 okay you
1759,17:59,firouzja,don't spread c4 Knight d4 d5 ok we'll
1800,18:00,carlsen,normally yeah now we'll go see five when
1803,18:03,carlsen,I still have the chance
1804,18:04,firouzja,play this should play this so it's going
1811,18:11,firouzja,to take us to be shot so I have space
1812,18:12,carlsen,yeah you can do this but I'm late at
1814,18:14,firouzja,advantage so we will see you will see
1815,18:15,carlsen,least I'm getting this Bishop hey I can
1817,18:17,firouzja,[Music]
1819,18:19,carlsen,also go be five let me just go be five
1820,18:20,firouzja,Knight c3 it's going to take and one
1822,18:22,carlsen,actually there should be four I got nine
1826,18:26,carlsen,of six no d6 shenanigans if you move the
1827,18:27,firouzja,night p6 mean we shall be four maybe
1829,18:29,carlsen,bishop I got be ca3 I always have 93
1838,18:38,carlsen,okay let me plan out of six so it's
1840,18:40,firouzja,Scottie three takes I take on before
1844,18:44,firouzja,because we shall be five then I have
1845,18:45,carlsen,trying to be very tricky oh I missed
1847,18:47,firouzja,achieved worth if it goes 96 then I take
1849,18:49,carlsen,something
1850,18:50,carlsen,I thought about takes rookie for her
1851,18:51,firouzja,and Knight c3 or take and t6 maybe
1853,18:53,carlsen,than Bishop f5 that doesn't work you can
1856,18:56,carlsen,still you can just go ap immediately
1857,18:57,firouzja,probably that works let's see if it goes
1901,19:01,carlsen,okay so I got to do this instead 96 I
1902,19:02,firouzja,Bishop a5 or maybe it was just make
1905,19:05,firouzja,these six Alexa chord and play against
1907,19:07,carlsen,suppose takes 94 I don't I don't like it
1908,19:08,firouzja,those phones okay so what can I do here
1914,19:14,carlsen,too much but I didn't feel like I had a
1914,19:14,firouzja,I need a strong move so write C 3 P 4
1919,19:19,carlsen,lot of choice um obviously you got it
1923,19:23,carlsen,he's got a pretty fearsome set of the
1923,19:23,firouzja,but are able to block it 94
1926,19:26,carlsen,pawn something on d5 and c5 but
1930,19:30,firouzja,yeah this is strange
1933,19:33,carlsen,they can also be able to lose and I have
1933,19:33,firouzja,I mean Portugal Bishop g5 before we
1938,19:38,carlsen,a little bit of an initiative at the
1940,19:40,carlsen,moment so let's see if I can use that to
1946,19:46,firouzja,shall define at 66 takes 25 finish 8th
1947,19:47,carlsen,my advantage
1949,19:49,carlsen,privilege it almighty for decentralized
1952,19:52,carlsen,the night I know the b2 is hanging but I
1956,19:56,carlsen,don't think that's massively important
1956,19:56,firouzja,okay let's put this guy here for now
2001,20:01,carlsen,so you guys night a4 it's a bit
2001,20:01,firouzja,[Music]
2002,20:02,firouzja,maybe he comes to b6 or something Bishop
2005,20:05,carlsen,surprising
2005,20:05,carlsen,g6 now d6 Bishop e7 doesn't look too bad
2009,20:09,firouzja,g5 is very strong thread so he has to
2011,20:11,firouzja,take he cannot race though so let's go
2013,20:13,carlsen,not if not an a4 could be very much out
2015,20:15,firouzja,TC okay so we up to 550 X on f3
2016,20:16,carlsen,of play she goes da six I got this b6
2022,20:22,carlsen,should be fine so you're gonna you got
2022,20:22,firouzja,Quincy 1 let's do it not
2024,20:24,carlsen,two connected passers but I feel like
2027,20:27,carlsen,all of my pieces are doing pretty well
2030,20:30,carlsen,at the moment so I don't think this
2031,20:31,firouzja,with glute but you should've 321 of six
2032,20:32,carlsen,should be clear at all so did you miss
2034,20:34,carlsen,Bishop f3 or you're trying to trick me
2037,20:37,carlsen,so mama Bishop f3
2037,20:37,firouzja,G of three then I have those two pounds
2041,20:41,firouzja,which is very strong we will say now we
2043,20:43,carlsen,Quincy one that must be the point
2046,20:46,firouzja,also calculate and if coin see one
2048,20:48,carlsen,I don't think I am refute that
2051,20:51,firouzja,Bishop six I take I'm going to see 420
2053,20:53,firouzja,french g3 I mean it's fine I don't know
2057,20:57,carlsen,that's reading ring if it just lucked
2057,20:57,firouzja,with better but it is fine proudly so
2100,21:00,carlsen,into a good longer nice when it could be
2103,21:03,firouzja,let's see it because f6 then I go Bishop
2104,21:04,carlsen,three nights
2108,21:08,firouzja,which rattles I have time advantage here
2111,21:11,firouzja,so he takes Queen c1 because of six so
2116,21:16,carlsen,okay I got a play I gotta play faster so
2118,21:18,firouzja,now which ones that later should take
2120,21:20,firouzja,this fine to context okay
2121,21:21,carlsen,gif I'm gonna go 96 but I'm not I'm not
2124,21:24,firouzja,I miss this one so kind of in c4 26:56
2125,21:25,carlsen,liking it too much I'm hoping the fact
2133,21:33,firouzja,Queen a fourth okay I should take Queen
2139,21:39,carlsen,that his knight could still be some way
2142,21:42,firouzja,d2 421 from the Queen Devon okay wait
2143,21:43,carlsen,out of joining the game could swing the
2147,21:47,carlsen,the balance in my favor but yeah as I
2152,21:52,carlsen,said not liking it too much yeah so
2152,21:52,firouzja,this is Queen eight five videos let's
2155,21:55,firouzja,see can I bring anything to the game
2157,21:57,carlsen,queer 5 trying to keep his queen from
2201,22:01,firouzja,maybe three divine let's go
2203,22:03,carlsen,getting to defy which I could think
2204,22:04,carlsen,could have been pretty bad news for me
2206,22:06,carlsen,okay Queen King h8 obviously Queen a5 I
2211,22:11,carlsen,think
2211,22:11,firouzja,[Music]
2212,22:12,carlsen,d7 I go group d8 I also got g4
2215,22:15,firouzja,seven and twenty five let's see how he's
2217,22:17,carlsen,they're coming up yeah 25 quite sensibly
2221,22:21,firouzja,going to play this you have 37 so here
2224,22:24,carlsen,I don't have time to think
2224,22:24,firouzja,if it's hard to play I have to play b3
2229,22:29,firouzja,somewhere Cooney for Quincy six okay
2231,22:31,carlsen,aquinnah for wanna go G for next fuck I
2236,22:36,carlsen,have to create that kind of planet Queen
2238,22:38,carlsen,c7 okay I'm gonna
2241,22:41,carlsen,I shouldn't should not take you probably
2242,22:42,firouzja,let's go peace Regis to start with
2247,22:47,carlsen,this was just really bad
2247,22:47,firouzja,cookie 655 okay six
2249,22:49,carlsen,okay trying to prevent nuts see if I
2252,22:52,carlsen,were to released now I think my position
2255,22:55,carlsen,is sort of okay but I'm losing on time
2255,22:55,firouzja,check okay I take the real kind sweet
2259,22:59,carlsen,that's okay yeah still there might be
2301,23:01,carlsen,six Brooke f6 sort of mmm I'm listing
2315,23:15,firouzja,okay but once I quit very good there so
2316,23:16,carlsen,time that's problem yeah okay decision
2318,23:18,firouzja,it's not about time witches I think we
2321,23:21,firouzja,should be five in seven was Daniels so
2322,23:22,carlsen,got too too complicated not good
2325,23:25,firouzja,[Music]
2326,23:26,firouzja,before I go if I if I say anything might
2327,23:27,carlsen,let me try this again feels like a
2332,23:32,carlsen,decent enough trace against him okay so
2332,23:32,firouzja,have three nights these things should be
2334,23:34,firouzja,five
2335,23:35,firouzja,let's go a six but I have to change
2339,23:39,firouzja,something here let's put these things so
2345,23:45,firouzja,c3 g6 let's play this way Castle I mean
2348,23:48,carlsen,he goes he goes for a different system
2351,23:51,carlsen,now guess I'm just gonna play it pretty
2353,23:53,firouzja,I could could be five I thought when I
2357,23:57,firouzja,teach five let's go be 57 first start
2359,23:59,carlsen,slowly
2404,24:04,firouzja,and create I might try some 94 so if K
2407,24:07,carlsen,okay nine of one so he's going for this
2413,24:13,carlsen,plan she wants to go maybe your 94 I'll
2416,24:16,firouzja,night if
2417,24:17,firouzja,exchange a lot of pieces and I'm not
2419,24:19,carlsen,make sure anyway
2422,24:22,firouzja,sure let's go for it
2423,24:23,firouzja,I don't know so let's say we shove this
2424,24:24,carlsen,preventing night h5 so actually getting
2427,24:27,carlsen,f5 is a bit more difficult friend okay
2427,24:27,firouzja,793 queen of 397 I'm going to try to
2431,24:31,carlsen,so I could take or so I could go CD yeah
2432,24:32,firouzja,push a 5 like so I don't think ok taste
2438,24:38,firouzja,this way
2438,24:38,firouzja,I'd like to under cut Bishop III I mean
2439,24:39,carlsen,I'm just go seeking feels feels a bit
2446,24:46,carlsen,easier to play
2449,24:49,firouzja,it's very hard to say push-ups the six
2456,24:56,carlsen,Bishop d7 on probably oh I'm just
2457,24:57,firouzja,take only five ninety 44 you know this
2500,25:00,carlsen,completely blind what am I even doing
2503,25:03,carlsen,I'm just completely missing that I got
2506,25:06,carlsen,the threat of CD and ambushed by three
2507,25:07,firouzja,is not good Alki play you should be fine
2509,25:09,carlsen,winning the exchange
2516,25:16,firouzja,just go say for you shop c6 it takes and
2517,25:17,carlsen,that's just no good at all now there
2522,25:22,carlsen,should be five a for just no good square
2524,25:24,carlsen,for the bishop so Bishop d6 d4 Knight d7
2524,25:24,firouzja,97 d4 yeah this is bad the plunger
2529,25:29,carlsen,I'm a d4 ninety four hours ago
2531,25:31,carlsen,d4 taking his bishop again so this is
2532,25:32,firouzja,twirly so Knight g4 thanks because it's
2534,25:34,carlsen,what he has to do but still de 1944 d5 h
2543,25:43,carlsen,three I think I'm just winning
2546,25:46,firouzja,Trina 96 this is bad now this is lost I
2550,25:50,carlsen,he's come try and muddy the waters some
2554,25:54,carlsen,way but I don't really see it yeah 94
2600,26:00,carlsen,just didn't work which was lucky for me
2601,26:01,firouzja,cannot do anything here yeah the ship
2602,26:02,carlsen,since that's not something I'd spotted
2604,26:04,carlsen,from from afar but it's not that big a
2609,26:09,firouzja,chief arrived now this was a very bad
2610,26:10,carlsen,surprise I can fish g5 right
2613,26:13,carlsen,you
2613,26:13,firouzja,game which sinks I should not play e5
2618,26:18,carlsen,yeah f6i technic Bishop f6 Bishop h6
2620,26:20,firouzja,then maybe I should switch to Sicilian
2624,26:24,carlsen,right
2626,26:26,firouzja,probably
2629,26:29,firouzja,the server was a five yeah
2631,26:31,carlsen,okay one okay this is gonna go over very
2639,26:39,carlsen,very soon ninety-four he's six
2642,26:42,firouzja,in c6 probably has a six here or Bishop
2648,26:48,firouzja,g5 and everything's on us yeah okay this
2650,26:50,carlsen,she's so many winning moves don't even
2653,26:53,carlsen,wanna lock in
2654,26:54,carlsen,f7 though he's gonna resign okay
2655,26:55,firouzja,was a bad game by plundered and sadly
2657,26:57,firouzja,but it's fine
2659,26:59,carlsen,evening the score again with this this
2659,26:59,firouzja,so he's going to change under Kenya so
2703,27:03,carlsen,is a tough match okay let me try
2703,27:03,firouzja,we go Knight c3
2705,27:05,carlsen,something else
2706,27:06,firouzja,let's go Knight c3 he's sinking because
2707,27:07,carlsen,enough of this alien nonsense what does
2712,27:12,carlsen,he want does he want P 64 I don't know
2713,27:13,firouzja,a6 so night of 3 + T 6 let's go
2716,27:16,carlsen,let me go a sick since I don't know what
2720,27:20,firouzja,g3 ninth of six Bishop g2 let's see how
2728,27:28,firouzja,it's going to play okay which three
2730,27:30,carlsen,to do here
2731,27:31,carlsen,g4 maybe can't be too mad so I'll take
2735,27:35,firouzja,takes and if I play you should detail
2737,27:37,carlsen,it 96 develop normally and a6 it's not
2740,27:40,firouzja,because g6 let's connect it - I'm trying
2741,27:41,carlsen,ideal but at least it's preparing d5 so
2748,27:48,firouzja,to play c3 d4 so let's say C 39523 31
2749,27:49,carlsen,don't think it's really a bad thing
2752,27:52,carlsen,he wants to go see three
2754,27:54,carlsen,for but I'm not really sure whether I
2800,28:00,carlsen,will actually allow that 97 fruity one I
2804,28:04,carlsen,got 95 maybe also I got c4 Queen b6 as
2806,28:06,firouzja,probably not
2808,28:08,firouzja,five Queen III see forward but I talking
2811,28:11,carlsen,an option I can also just allow it take
2813,28:13,firouzja,it's very bad like I put up III cancel
2815,28:15,carlsen,and Queen b6 a bitch b3 I can take on b2
2819,28:19,firouzja,it before it's interesting
2821,28:21,carlsen,it's an interesting position but I
2824,28:24,firouzja,let's see see 44 Queenie 353 let's see
2826,28:26,carlsen,shouldn't repeat my mistake of just
2830,28:30,carlsen,getting way too low in time huh okay let
2834,28:34,carlsen,me just go for this c4 you can go they
2835,28:35,firouzja,if it goes defined it looks very
2839,28:39,carlsen,can go b3 somehow it wasn't too worried
2839,28:39,firouzja,dangerous but you might play it because
2842,28:42,firouzja,might not have other choice
2843,28:43,carlsen,about this one so I feel like the
2845,28:45,carlsen,structure even if you gots to take and
2845,28:45,firouzja,they just goes castle
2847,28:47,carlsen,on c4 will not be too bad for me I'm
2848,28:48,firouzja,so if form is I don't see it
2851,28:51,carlsen,just missing f4 and what's linked what
2853,28:53,carlsen,is up with me you can just win a pawn
2854,28:54,firouzja,so he's we going to be late eNOS okay
2858,28:58,carlsen,that it's just saying yeah not good yeah
2858,28:58,firouzja,this is 34 white I don't see why it
2901,29:01,firouzja,should be bad for me probably 100
2905,29:05,firouzja,something because you're like 4.0 so
2909,29:09,carlsen,position is not hopeless which is not
2909,29:09,firouzja,let's see I have to convert this so 95
2914,29:14,carlsen,ideal
2915,29:15,firouzja,t3 and p5 I just take take group tanks
2916,29:16,carlsen,my day far
2918,29:18,carlsen,d 3 then B fire doesn't seem to work
2922,29:22,carlsen,yeah okay fine
2923,29:23,firouzja,they both we need five I mean I could
2926,29:26,carlsen,Guinan when i finally gonna try that
2928,29:28,firouzja,take I got these three yeah let's just
2929,29:29,carlsen,rook d7 queen a two other feeling that
2932,29:32,carlsen,if I could be strong on if he does go d3
2933,29:33,firouzja,do it
2934,29:34,firouzja,you might talk to me for that we need
2936,29:36,carlsen,then he will have at least weaken some
2937,29:37,firouzja,for Quincy for maybe hey thanks if it
2939,29:39,carlsen,school yeah but now he's weakened some
2941,29:41,carlsen,squares I got I got rook b8 take it he's
2944,29:44,firouzja,takes e5 probably goes would be to
2948,29:48,carlsen,got a e5 now but at least I got Ruby to
2949,29:49,firouzja,thanking a fanmeeting Queen a for I
2951,29:51,carlsen,maybe it's nothing
2953,29:53,firouzja,missed okay miss Queenie for again okay
2956,29:56,carlsen,yeah just working one ok let me try this
2958,29:58,carlsen,instead
2960,29:60,firouzja,this is me that's called the father and
3008,30:08,firouzja,Queenie for you create
3009,30:09,carlsen,Gentile
3010,30:10,carlsen,cracking throat oh he goes Queenie for
3014,30:14,carlsen,rooks yet what is his point he wants to
3014,30:14,firouzja,the five let's see if we can make things
3017,30:17,carlsen,go ahead fine yeah well no at least I
3019,30:19,firouzja,complicated a little bit chief or let's
3021,30:21,carlsen,got my pawn back go on some sort of
3026,30:26,carlsen,expedition with the Queen should not be
3030,30:30,carlsen,too bad now I got some squares for the
3032,30:32,firouzja,go in III microphone 95 or just push the
3033,30:33,carlsen,bishop my life is very very bad
3036,30:36,carlsen,that's a problem g5 I don't think was a
3038,30:38,carlsen,great move g4 I mean this one whoever is
3040,30:40,firouzja,point one eight five I might cut Bishop
3043,30:43,carlsen,a bit tricky to meet uh-huh he wants to
3045,30:45,firouzja,g5 + g5 attacking like that so maybe he
3048,30:48,carlsen,go g5 I'm just gonna go G find myself
3049,30:49,firouzja,has to keep the night to DA so how can i
3053,30:53,carlsen,not loving it though
3055,30:55,carlsen,I gotta speed up that's my manager here
3056,30:56,firouzja,play this book see 193 okay those 95 so
3108,31:08,carlsen,yeah he gets this one it's not not ideal
3112,31:12,firouzja,94 alright I will go look at one Queen
3119,31:19,carlsen,that's not kind of play with Knight b3
3120,31:20,firouzja,can I go can be six Quincy to 9th of six
3121,31:21,carlsen,coming up don't know exactly what kind
3124,31:24,firouzja,six takes they just goes this way in b7
3125,31:25,carlsen,of player but there should be some will
3127,31:27,carlsen,Queen b6 is a good move the King g7
3131,31:31,carlsen,though is working fades 95 I'm just
3132,31:32,firouzja,look the eighth night c5 this is a piece
3140,31:40,firouzja,okay I should take this way this Mikey
3141,31:41,carlsen,gonna have to yeah I'm just gonna have
3142,31:42,carlsen,to sack that night take it does feel
3146,31:46,firouzja,Michael for so I should be careful night
3152,31:52,firouzja,if I finish okay let's go queenie 496 it
3153,31:53,carlsen,from a practical point of view that this
3155,31:55,carlsen,is far from lost 95 okay I guess I'll go
3201,32:01,carlsen,Rudy Nate Rudy two of just trying to
3205,32:05,firouzja,gets activated here
3208,32:08,carlsen,keep some activity next I just want to
3211,32:11,carlsen,push the aid and pawn my King is pretty
3212,32:12,firouzja,yeah so what can I do here I don't have
3215,32:15,carlsen,safe that's a good thing Queen B -
3217,32:17,firouzja,move 3 ok draw I think my had winning
3226,32:26,carlsen,keeping some pressure there a3 if it
3228,32:28,carlsen,tastes already four can't take now at
3238,32:38,carlsen,the release my position is
3239,32:39,carlsen,ike objectively speaking but I have
3242,32:42,carlsen,serious problems with time of course
3247,32:47,carlsen,that was stupid now it's just gonna flag
3250,32:50,carlsen,me
3250,32:50,carlsen,oh that's the repetition okay I guess
3251,32:51,firouzja,position now he is very fast in this
3254,32:54,firouzja,side so ok so if I have to change my
3257,32:57,carlsen,good for me I was a piece down suffering
3259,32:59,carlsen,most of the game so the drawer should be
3259,32:59,firouzja,mind so let's go see fine it's good
3303,33:03,firouzja,timing off maybe goes g3
3304,33:04,carlsen,fine
3305,33:05,carlsen,okay so no more e6 sorry no more d5 you
3309,33:09,firouzja,so 96 might have 6 to 5 he wants to go
3315,33:15,carlsen,wants to yeah he doesn't want you need
3322,33:22,firouzja,Kings Indian attack which I don't think
3324,33:24,firouzja,is dangerous I don't know ok this way so
3325,33:25,carlsen,to have that easier life so they're just
3329,33:29,carlsen,I'm gonna go you five now the point is
3335,33:35,carlsen,if I allow Castle then night yet can
3335,33:35,firouzja,if I go t4 because like to show before
3338,33:38,firouzja,and get this set up properly and not
3339,33:39,carlsen,sometimes be a good move sort of
3344,33:44,carlsen,claiming that this is more precise now
3346,33:46,carlsen,of course he can go d4 and then he
3347,33:47,firouzja,sure what to do here exactly
3349,33:49,carlsen,doesn't actually have to to Castle
3350,33:50,firouzja,I mean Queen c7
3352,33:52,carlsen,kingside so it's most certainly a
3354,33:54,carlsen,double-edged sword but at least we got
3357,33:57,carlsen,some sort of strategical fight here
3359,33:59,carlsen,should be good for me just way too much
3402,34:02,carlsen,street fighting when I'm in my black
3403,34:03,firouzja,okay let's see if it takes
3405,34:05,carlsen,games I'm really missing a lot of a lot
3410,34:10,carlsen,of tactical stuff mmm
3413,34:13,firouzja,it could take I'm gonna show before but
3414,34:14,carlsen,Queen c7 looks very dubious yes I'll
3417,34:17,firouzja,then Queen age five should marry okay 93
3418,34:18,carlsen,take 93 what's this intention yeah 96
3426,34:26,firouzja,96 95 28 this is very dangerous very
3437,34:37,carlsen,now I guess you can play this way I'm
3437,34:37,firouzja,dangerous be sure before you should be
3441,34:41,carlsen,gonna go fish before should be 6h for
3442,34:42,firouzja,six okay if I could get away with this
3450,34:50,firouzja,then I'm fine
3453,34:53,carlsen,probably when you go 95 next although
3453,34:53,firouzja,27 let's page six
3457,34:57,carlsen,I'm allowing 94 and that I'm not loving
3503,35:03,firouzja,I might go long castle at some point
3505,35:05,carlsen,castles I guess hmm I probably haven't
3510,35:10,firouzja,because of FG 5 so we will see yeah I
3517,35:17,carlsen,played this very incisively but at least
3519,35:19,firouzja,should I mean let's go home castle who
3526,35:26,carlsen,it's going to be sort of difficult
3527,35:27,firouzja,cares
3528,35:28,carlsen,friend to castle right as I said that he
3528,35:28,firouzja,let's go home castle and g5 it is not
3533,35:33,carlsen,does castles Queen site with no regards
3537,35:37,carlsen,for regard for Humanity 0h5 okay let me
3537,35:37,firouzja,worth it to not play this here my
3547,35:47,firouzja,quickly for for sure yes so let's go 5
3550,35:50,carlsen,pay for just trying to know him over
3552,35:52,carlsen,there okay
3557,35:57,firouzja,ok 95
3601,36:01,carlsen,jump into b5 or is hoping that g5
3605,36:05,carlsen,doesn't make me
3605,36:05,firouzja,hmm should I turn 45 no I should go for
3612,36:12,firouzja,it you should go for it
3614,36:14,carlsen,now take it
3616,36:16,carlsen,95 Bishop g5 next yeah it was for this
3616,36:16,firouzja,so if I take things we shall be three or
3620,36:20,firouzja,four before yeah that's a four well
3641,36:41,firouzja,maybe just calculate and take on t8 with
3643,36:43,firouzja,not sure they create yeah it feels like
3644,36:44,carlsen,may be a bishop yet I think I for looks
3647,36:47,carlsen,ok takes it now I take back and our
3653,36:53,firouzja,I'm very slow because of Michelin g510
3656,36:56,firouzja,he plays here which stinks she stinks I
3657,36:57,carlsen,Bishop f6 wreckage 3
3706,37:06,carlsen,got three so I'm not massively worried
3709,37:09,carlsen,about that now I want to go king f2 and
3711,37:11,carlsen,then rock h1 that's what I missed
3712,37:12,firouzja,should be careful mrs. check King v8
3716,37:16,carlsen,okay I gotta protect okay whoopsie woman
3719,37:19,firouzja,right before the thing is miss playing
3722,37:22,firouzja,it very badly I don't know like Jake's
3723,37:23,carlsen,I'm missing the a for his hanging
3726,37:26,carlsen,unbelievable so bad and know there was a
3727,37:27,firouzja,takes yeah and should take so let's see
3731,37:31,carlsen,reason I shouldn't do that now our
3733,37:33,carlsen,position is just collapsing see three of
3738,37:38,carlsen,listen trying to forage I have a feeling
3744,37:44,carlsen,this is not going to look cool
3744,37:44,firouzja,let's see
3745,37:45,carlsen,this is not gonna end well for me okay
3745,37:45,firouzja,I should be fast
3753,37:53,carlsen,one he's got beef I though just to solid
3756,37:56,firouzja,[Music]
3757,37:57,firouzja,this was before 95 yeah this is losing
3759,37:59,carlsen,don't know it to be here Queenie - well
3803,38:03,carlsen,I'm see for now at least I get to read
3807,38:07,carlsen,appoint take any fun what's the problem
3812,38:12,carlsen,Queen c6 queen of three gesso goes
3815,38:15,carlsen,Queen's off then I got to take a beat
3816,38:16,firouzja,I have no trying of again I'm not versed
3819,38:19,carlsen,595 I didn't say that hmm my bishop is
3820,38:20,firouzja,here let's see ok blunder this route
3830,38:30,carlsen,really badly out of play
3832,38:32,carlsen,okay okay my blunder Brooke this way
3836,38:36,firouzja,okay okay I knew that people to anger
3838,38:38,carlsen,instead huh afternoon okay I'm just
3845,38:45,carlsen,gonna resign that was so bad so so bad
3846,38:46,firouzja,because it was only thing in each one so
3849,38:49,carlsen,wait why can't I just make some some
3850,38:50,firouzja,okay 43 I think is the result
3854,38:54,firouzja,at least I managed to bring my black in
3856,38:56,carlsen,some solid moves when I have the chance
3857,38:57,firouzja,now so they before let's go ahead should
3858,38:58,carlsen,instead of all this nonsense
3902,39:02,carlsen,unbelievable sessions I'm just
3905,39:05,firouzja,be three actually I got a good position
3908,39:08,firouzja,look him one night f3 I mean before
3910,39:10,carlsen,completely
3910,39:10,carlsen,collapsing in this case
3917,39:17,carlsen,you
3917,39:17,firouzja,might be 45 X takes I cut this position
3919,39:19,carlsen,I do have the feeling that my position
3922,39:22,carlsen,was just kind of good from the opening
3924,39:24,carlsen,here so I'm not true averse to repeating
3924,39:24,firouzja,not sure how is this assessment okay dot
3926,39:26,carlsen,so I'm just gonna take the bishop my
3927,39:27,firouzja,d5 so he wants to make c3 this is a big
3928,39:28,carlsen,thing gonna be fine none of the more
3931,39:31,carlsen,allowing fish before okay and that be
3936,39:36,carlsen,six I guess we should bet five so there
3938,39:38,firouzja,deal that I've I could see that but we
3941,39:41,firouzja,should use it
3942,39:42,carlsen,should be seven I guess I got this pizza
3943,39:43,firouzja,because f6 now right for justice not
3950,39:50,carlsen,nice English piece on
3956,39:56,firouzja,sure what to do here
4000,40:00,carlsen,yeah Bishop e7 97 Queen d8 root D aids
4001,40:01,firouzja,51 9320 English 94 so let's see look see
4009,40:09,carlsen,rookie 7 Bishop f3 work t2 I guess I can
4012,40:12,carlsen,make a draw my a for looks a bit weird
4021,40:21,firouzja,I thought we should be stolen maybe 97
4026,40:26,firouzja,28 t8 rookie 7 fish of f3 f3 that is
4027,40:27,carlsen,okay so exists
4028,40:28,carlsen,CIT still got calendar works and it's
4035,40:35,firouzja,good
4036,40:36,carlsen,too rubbish p7 but I can play c4 then
4036,40:36,firouzja,that one's good 54 let's eat before
4044,40:44,carlsen,try and be a bit clever yeah that is
4045,40:45,firouzja,okay miss before it is it good like we
4053,40:53,firouzja,need for yesterday Queen I think I'm
4059,40:59,firouzja,using a lot of time but it should be
4102,41:02,carlsen,clever I 97 is got Queen design so I got
4102,41:02,firouzja,worse sit here okay hit probably okay
4106,41:06,carlsen,to trade this way and I don't get the
4108,41:08,carlsen,rogue - I don't get the rogue - okay I'm
4112,41:12,firouzja,Ruby hey I think yeah 93 he takes I take
4114,41:14,carlsen,just gonna take them route p8 this is
4118,41:18,firouzja,let's just all agree one would be five
4120,41:20,carlsen,gonna be a draw although yes
4125,41:25,firouzja,group c4 he's going to take on pizza
4129,41:29,carlsen,I advise someone precisely but takes
4130,41:30,firouzja,probably the shoot
4135,41:35,firouzja,between here yes if he has to take
4138,41:38,firouzja,because if 5p3 not sure I'm not sure
4139,41:39,carlsen,things work a 7 roof d8 roof t7 let's
4144,41:44,carlsen,feel a bit tricky
4145,41:45,carlsen,Brooke t2 no it's not an obvious strong
4146,41:46,firouzja,okay he goes a fight
4150,41:50,firouzja,III okay so Kim G - if one should I go
4151,41:51,carlsen,so bad just so bad so give a check now
4157,41:57,carlsen,for lack of any better ideas trying to
4204,42:04,firouzja,for a vein rupesh 5h4
4206,42:06,firouzja,yeah I took a cookie for kinky - project
4208,42:08,carlsen,somehow displaces rook e8 I want to play
4216,42:16,firouzja,was not a good idea to change for looks
4221,42:21,firouzja,it you okay now he plays for me but I
4228,42:28,carlsen,for a win don't know one
4231,42:31,firouzja,will give him this is fine point
4232,42:32,carlsen,what justification I just I can't keep
4234,42:34,firouzja,probably okay he ate that this is my
4235,42:35,carlsen,begging for a draw okay five kage five
4244,42:44,carlsen,take age for this is got Ruby fly though
4248,42:48,carlsen,so he's okay then I take 58 choice for
4254,42:54,firouzja,piss place is bad near should not lose
4255,42:55,firouzja,still but okay to be fine
4256,42:56,carlsen,this hmm I guess that's clever
4304,43:04,carlsen,that was a mild sleep I wanted to go
4306,43:06,carlsen,Ruby fine probably was a good sleep
4308,43:08,carlsen,though unbelievable
4309,43:09,firouzja,eat okay I will donate before he has to
4313,43:13,carlsen,I'll get Bishop d8 and then push I'm not
4317,43:17,carlsen,worried here
4318,43:18,carlsen,definitely not worse probably not really
4320,43:20,firouzja,risk here I think okay 95 once the Queen
4326,43:26,carlsen,better either
4327,43:27,carlsen,okay I gotta play for a while gotta play
4331,43:31,carlsen,for a win
4331,43:31,firouzja,is fine
4332,43:32,firouzja,[Music]
4333,43:33,carlsen,let's see six like I broke d1 of Keaney
4333,43:33,firouzja,gingy - okay six so now he has to give
4336,43:36,carlsen,to agony true age three sorry but
4340,43:40,carlsen,obviously it's not this one i I didn't
4342,43:42,firouzja,me temple before me yeah I'm very slow
4343,43:43,carlsen,see however that's a bit of a blow I
4350,43:50,carlsen,gotta try and be fast that was a weak
4358,43:58,carlsen,move I think nom definitely not worse
4401,44:01,firouzja,yeah it was variously this game now it
4403,44:03,carlsen,would be to I'm better take it
4406,44:06,firouzja,was like me right
4408,44:08,firouzja,what I did to that position is amazing
4409,44:09,carlsen,yeah that's ready five six I guess than
4416,44:16,carlsen,a five it has no squares for you it's
4419,44:19,carlsen,night rook F to King g5 and at least
4426,44:26,carlsen,objectively speaking I'm winning there's
4426,44:26,firouzja,yeah this was bad him I had very good
4430,44:30,carlsen,no stalemate okay okay
4430,44:30,firouzja,position but blunders so badly
4434,44:34,carlsen,messy game but once again I'm back to
4437,44:37,firouzja,okay goes back to d4 so let's go here
4438,44:38,carlsen,even
4441,44:41,carlsen,which I must say is an achievement for
4444,44:44,carlsen,me so okay enough of that Queens gambit
4447,44:47,carlsen,nonsense I'm going for simple chess yeah
4447,44:47,firouzja,hmm
4448,44:48,firouzja,exclusive 5 this is 7 micro some c4 idea
4459,44:59,carlsen,maybe what he's doing here is clever see
4503,45:03,firouzja,let's see okay he just takes and c4m so
4504,45:04,carlsen,397 I cannot prevent e5 okay I'm just
4507,45:07,carlsen,kind of DC then please I have some good
4510,45:10,carlsen,memories of my game with with your
4510,45:10,firouzja,[Music]
4512,45:12,carlsen,career here from the wind blades
4512,45:12,firouzja,T takes before because I'm not losing
4517,45:17,carlsen,frightfully secured me in the 120s if b5
4523,45:23,firouzja,take some t6 you go to that end game
4528,45:28,firouzja,okay let's open his fish file if it
4530,45:30,carlsen,whenever then I just go Bishop c4 so he
4531,45:31,firouzja,wants
4534,45:34,carlsen,takes he wants to be safe but I think
4539,45:39,carlsen,it's a little bit worse Bishop e3
4545,45:45,firouzja,"Bishop D7 Queen B4, he goes Queen d2 probably"
4546,45:46,carlsen,degrees 94 to con I didn't see that
4555,45:55,carlsen,check okay I'm just gonna trade my lefty
4556,45:56,firouzja,okay we should be fine I will go if it
4602,46:02,carlsen,to maybe six is a bit weird
4602,46:02,firouzja,was mined so I could connect a sticks I
4607,46:07,firouzja,think we should see 658 King f8 King g7
4612,46:12,carlsen,96 I missed this one
4629,46:29,firouzja,[Music]
4630,46:30,carlsen,yeah that's a bit unfortunate I'm not
4632,46:32,firouzja,Joseph tree rocky 894 night before king
4634,46:34,carlsen,really in time for anything I think e
4635,46:35,carlsen,for root dat 594 doesn't look very good
4638,46:38,firouzja,he - we should be five by having good
4642,46:42,carlsen,hmm so just go to a three a 94 I'm
4642,46:42,firouzja,positions it's fine service okay night
4649,46:49,firouzja,before should be played okay
4652,46:52,carlsen,admitting that this didn't go too well
4655,46:55,firouzja,because here nagoba should be five and
4656,46:56,carlsen,k2
4659,46:59,carlsen,a three don't think I'm losing my force
4702,47:02,firouzja,ninety three goes Roxie Roxie eight I
4707,47:07,carlsen,93 I Roxy 241 it's bit annoying a little
4711,47:11,firouzja,have two products in it of course
4716,47:16,firouzja,good tea wine okay let's connect see
4721,47:21,firouzja,five be sure before he goes be three I
4726,47:26,carlsen,bit force which I shouldn't British in
4726,47:26,firouzja,got we should be five okay let's see he
4730,47:30,carlsen,the bin after here are to the opening I
4734,47:34,firouzja,has a very clumsy pieces but should use
4740,47:40,carlsen,- 1 - gotta speed up 95 I think I go
4740,47:40,firouzja,it so let's take ok wants some Nike some
4746,47:46,firouzja,jumps you want some jumps okay let's go
4750,47:50,carlsen,back now that is - maybe you can take I
4753,47:53,firouzja,which five or Pat h5 v 8 we need
4806,48:06,firouzja,negative 5 I don't know
4810,48:10,firouzja,this position is very weird I'm up on
4816,48:16,firouzja,trial this is a good thing I am better
4820,48:20,firouzja,here but I should be I should have some
4822,48:22,carlsen,don't know we'll see
4824,48:24,firouzja,plan let's jump

4841,48:41,firouzja,[Music]
4842,48:42,firouzja,I shouldn't say that's going fine
4847,48:47,carlsen,his a bit better it's not ideal
4850,48:50,firouzja,everything is hanging everything is
4851,48:51,carlsen,I just five
4855,48:55,firouzja,hanging okay
4858,48:58,carlsen,oh yeah it's not so easy for me to find
4901,49:01,carlsen,him up because I'm gonna go can you talk
4901,49:01,firouzja,can you faint big stakes
4905,49:05,carlsen,but I don't know what I'm doing next - I
4909,49:09,carlsen,have to go you for and keep the night
4910,49:10,carlsen,away please got nights now that could be
4911,49:11,firouzja,96 cut off on time
4918,49:18,carlsen,annoyingly jumpy I'm very happy to get
4920,49:20,carlsen,95 oh I think you missed that no I'm
4925,49:25,carlsen,fine hmm okay 93 I forget before yeah
4926,49:26,firouzja,[Music]
4937,49:37,firouzja,
4938,49:38,carlsen,yet this one okay let me take it before
4940,49:40,firouzja,okay this is again in d6 d7 to be 8k
4945,49:45,carlsen,I can you say now he's gonna try and
4952,49:52,carlsen,fight me I immediately run or something
4956,49:56,firouzja,blender this one might watch you forever
5004,50:04,firouzja,[Music]
5005,50:05,firouzja,okay seven we cannot take we cannot also
5007,50:07,carlsen,okay I'm not you're worried about this
5009,50:09,carlsen,pawn king do you find it so tricky
5014,50:14,firouzja,take this one okay
5030,50:30,carlsen,allow the exchange there I'm gonna get
5032,50:32,firouzja,a flattened but my first outbreak human
5033,50:33,carlsen,flagged are you so I know I know that
5036,50:36,firouzja,do any game so this is a good thing I
5038,50:38,firouzja,was out playing him so okay so let's go
5045,50:45,carlsen,this guy is a lot better than the other
5046,50:46,firouzja,again he's switching to a looking he's
5047,50:47,carlsen,guys I've played but still I mean just
5049,50:49,carlsen,place just completely on wack it's
5053,50:53,firouzja,[Music]
5054,50:54,carlsen,really vexing I mean I'm just constantly
5055,50:55,firouzja,had a good position t1
5100,51:00,carlsen,doubting myself it's all a total mess
5106,51:06,firouzja,you will take again I had a good
5108,51:08,carlsen,so I'm just assuming that I was doing
5110,51:10,firouzja,position in the ingame so you'll see he
5111,51:11,carlsen,fine in a couple of this games yeah this
5115,51:15,firouzja,has to come up with some new plan might
5117,51:17,carlsen,is a very strange ground to have a
5119,51:19,carlsen,theoretical discussion kind of taken d5
5120,51:20,firouzja,just Co native six this game here
5125,51:25,firouzja,[Music]
5127,51:27,firouzja,it'll see so night of six-day this one
5132,51:32,firouzja,again my toe is six now okay Bishop g5
5136,51:36,carlsen,Knight b6 yeah it's pretty insane just
5144,51:44,firouzja,he had this wait can I copy should be
5146,51:46,carlsen,to play the extracting decision but I
5149,51:49,firouzja,seven now
5153,51:53,firouzja,like late night eight for Bishop e7 97
5154,51:54,carlsen,got to I've been doing please pretty
5157,51:57,firouzja,28 38 take 652 took me only 54 just west
5158,51:58,carlsen,okay the previous can I really do feel
5205,52:05,carlsen,that okay I have got 96 friend gonna try
5209,52:09,firouzja,play 94 against those might be six my
5217,52:17,carlsen,that blundering again net you can take
5220,52:20,firouzja,Quincy 294 so I do I have to take and
5222,52:22,carlsen,him deep in c5 so when I was
5226,52:26,firouzja,take not sure is better in the same game
5228,52:28,carlsen,King about mistakes and now 95 then I
5231,52:31,carlsen,take and then I will Brook d5 this is
5235,52:35,carlsen,also a blunder by the way because I
5236,52:36,carlsen,didn't say that East 7 was hanging it is
5237,52:37,firouzja,okay
5240,52:40,firouzja,he once you create and everything's
5244,52:44,firouzja,hanging would be one hopefully I didn't
5254,52:54,firouzja,longer anything Bishop III my mother
5257,52:57,carlsen,still not a disaster for me
5301,53:01,carlsen,but I don't know maybe we should play
5301,53:01,firouzja,condo 96 57
5303,53:03,firouzja,
5304,53:04,carlsen,threes it's a good move bitch was not
5309,53:09,carlsen,hanging what am I thinking about
5313,53:13,carlsen,we're like you're thinking about can
5317,53:17,carlsen,trying this and then go 95 but I don't
5322,53:22,carlsen,believe it too much that's probably
5323,53:23,firouzja,this let's write will be three you go
5328,53:28,firouzja,for some okay now I got 97 I think I was
5334,53:34,firouzja,waiting for at least so I think now it's
5338,53:38,carlsen,clever so you can then I go rook c5 it's
5338,53:38,firouzja,fine yeah okay that could be six at
5347,53:47,carlsen,got to go b6 right you know oh yeah I'm
5347,53:47,firouzja,least I defended to defy the score for
5349,53:49,firouzja,his night should be draw but today I'm
5355,53:55,firouzja,pushing and I should not get me that
5357,53:57,firouzja,this is very important he's pushing here
5358,53:58,carlsen,gonna try and keep the knight on the
5359,53:59,carlsen,board I could have gone Knight d5
5402,54:02,carlsen,probably forcing the trade and then
5404,54:04,carlsen,would have been fair the dryish but I
5406,54:06,firouzja,at home
5407,54:07,carlsen,feel like my chances are not too bad
5410,54:10,firouzja,so before g5
5411,54:11,carlsen,here from a practical point of view so
5414,54:14,carlsen,I'm gonna roll the dice just a bit now
5418,54:18,carlsen,it's a really good move
5418,54:18,firouzja,he's not going for okay three probably
5422,54:22,firouzja,[Music]
5425,54:25,carlsen,yeah publican
5426,54:26,firouzja,yeah so nice before - to get one okay he
5427,54:27,carlsen,five no I can't do that
5436,54:36,carlsen,yeah no house to try and hustle here oh
5437,54:37,firouzja,had to pay money thing it is drawn okay
5441,54:41,carlsen,now I'm gonna try it okay I'm gonna have
5446,54:46,firouzja,okay it's fine
5447,54:47,carlsen,to draw of course okay there's any more
5448,54:48,firouzja,[Music]
5450,54:50,firouzja,so let's play c5 Knight of 6
5453,54:53,carlsen,one I guess five and a half two whatever
5500,55:00,carlsen,okay goes for this - I don't why I'm
5501,55:01,firouzja,these six was a 386 I mean just go h6
5506,55:06,carlsen,doing this okay you say so we're gonna
5510,55:10,carlsen,go G for us at it against natives here
5512,55:12,carlsen,the other day I do feel that this must
5514,55:14,firouzja,so if because each four people knight c6
5517,55:17,carlsen,be a pretty decent liner for me can I go
5520,55:20,carlsen,age for now I'm gonna do it
5521,55:21,firouzja,if it goes with g1 h 5 maybe not sure
5522,55:22,carlsen,by Katherine list so we got a service
5529,55:29,carlsen,seven again with these strange moves a
5529,55:29,firouzja,group 2 it's like press attacked what's
5532,55:32,firouzja,80386 included not sure who is getting
5534,55:34,carlsen,three and a six included yeah
5538,55:38,carlsen,don't know what to think about that
5538,55:38,firouzja,that manager in the cresset IP they take
5539,55:39,carlsen,please now Jeff is that the series issue
5545,55:45,firouzja,on each five I think yeah so takes we
5546,55:46,carlsen,okay G 594 totally just gonna take and
5552,55:52,carlsen,then two fine it might be three yes
5553,55:53,firouzja,should be five let's scope might be six
5557,55:57,firouzja,here he doesn't have might be five so
5602,56:02,firouzja,maybe I'm having the advantage stir
5607,56:07,firouzja,those that we should be too I guess and
5608,56:08,carlsen,pretty standard carries the tag stuff
5612,56:12,carlsen,but with the inclusion of courses a
5613,56:13,firouzja,might have six you want H five a g6
5615,56:15,carlsen,sticks a knife or 8 a 3 a 3 knife a 6
5620,56:20,firouzja,I mean rook c8 okay it goes on Castle we
5621,56:21,carlsen,and it's not clear that it's to his
5630,56:30,carlsen,benefit
5631,56:31,carlsen,Oh although of course a 6 is a more
5635,56:35,carlsen,standard neither Trevanian move and yeah
5635,56:35,firouzja,think it will play on console probably
5642,56:42,carlsen,I think it sound so clear that one
5643,56:43,firouzja,because clean f2 is very risky move
5646,56:46,firouzja,okay just cause we should is repack
5650,56:50,carlsen,beaver should be three I'm assuming his
5650,56:50,firouzja,Queen c7 long castle maybe he's having
5652,56:52,carlsen,intention is to go 95 next so I was kind
5655,56:55,firouzja,another plan okay he has to go Castle
5656,56:56,carlsen,of wanting to go f4 now
5702,57:02,carlsen,yeah just Castle looks good 95 UI for
5704,57:04,firouzja,yeah so it should be 70 takes I could
5707,57:07,carlsen,tank special D for should be friendly up
5709,57:09,firouzja,play the game
5711,57:11,carlsen,in there
5711,57:11,firouzja,I'm not sure
5713,57:13,carlsen,no I'm not push page six there should be
5717,57:17,carlsen,five takes then keen fades not so sure
5717,57:17,firouzja,we don't know what to do here yeah
5722,57:22,firouzja,that's copy 5 he goes for yeah and night
5726,57:26,carlsen,he goes be five I guess I gotta go right
5735,57:35,firouzja,eight five three be to make sticks be
5739,57:39,firouzja,should be for to page seven two two five
5744,57:44,firouzja,I have to play slicing but he has is
5753,57:53,firouzja,your position yes is your position for
5759,57:59,firouzja,short so does King okay he just takes so
5802,58:02,carlsen,hmm not too convinced by this month
5807,58:07,carlsen,because I've taken 54 if ePHI takes
5807,58:07,firouzja,now I have some counter play maybe is
5811,58:11,carlsen,Bishop h6 r g5 think that's pretty good
5812,58:12,firouzja,before then I have to go okay to seven
5815,58:15,carlsen,for me let me try it anyway
5816,58:16,firouzja,because if life takes before 95 now root
5818,58:18,carlsen,Oh Bishop h6 i also got Bishop e3 just a
5822,58:22,firouzja,each time so you go through q5 Bishop e7
5826,58:26,carlsen,blind yeah so he goes rogue h7 now I can
5831,58:31,carlsen,go can be one also that 5 was
5832,58:32,firouzja,[Music]
5833,58:33,firouzja,have to push
5834,58:34,carlsen,pro-slavery pretty strong with the same
5836,58:36,carlsen,idea Bishop h6 and just wish b3 tonight
5839,58:39,firouzja,let's push night a - okay put on dirt
5845,58:45,carlsen,a too strong
5846,58:46,firouzja,yeah so 94 525 fish every seven of
5858,58:58,carlsen,totally got it all night at 4:00
5901,59:01,carlsen,I feel like I'm just considerably better
5903,59:03,firouzja,course
5906,59:06,carlsen,right before SpaceX is coming page five
5908,59:08,firouzja,yeah yeah this is bad
5920,59:20,firouzja,everywhere is bad in v6 you could just
5940,59:40,firouzja,take money 6 g 7 but yeah it takes yeah
5944,59:44,carlsen,okay yeah he's trying to complicate it I
5947,59:47,carlsen,think I'm just I think I'm just winning
5951,59:51,carlsen,on 93 it's all pretty solid and yeah
5957,59:57,firouzja,this was a bad game okay we'll see
5959,59:59,carlsen,he's got um solvable problems there okay
6003,60:03,firouzja,before because negative 6 because you
6008,60:08,carlsen,okay can you go for try something more
6008,60:08,firouzja,guys today is a position ok change to
6012,60:12,firouzja,Lopes when it goes negative 6 again T 3
6015,60:15,carlsen,solid I have six what I beat it with in
6019,60:19,firouzja,C 3 cancel 92 let's go rookie 1 show
6021,60:21,carlsen,vikon's they should still be still there
6024,60:24,carlsen,okay right
6025,60:25,carlsen,unless he's come up with something new
6029,60:29,carlsen,and brilliant my supposed to be fine I
6030,60:30,firouzja,before it's gone I have one see what you
6036,60:36,firouzja,got here
6040,60:40,firouzja,b5 we should be three Michael Bishop d7
6046,60:46,carlsen,guess we should be three
6048,60:48,firouzja,I don't know he's using a lot of time
6050,60:50,carlsen,so it's surprising go age six
6055,60:55,firouzja,here so 93 those Bishop e6 shops III
6105,61:05,carlsen,Bhishma six rupees 6495 is playable this
6105,61:05,firouzja,wants t5 probably not I don't know we
6109,61:09,firouzja,justified so text she just takes
6111,61:11,carlsen,I don't see your invitation now at d5
6114,61:14,carlsen,should I have a very decent position she
6117,61:17,firouzja,okay so Queenie - hmm because g6 let's
6119,61:19,carlsen,doesn't have the usual like Italian sort
6122,61:22,carlsen,of play with knighted for and everything
6124,61:24,carlsen,as long as the as long as the bishop is
6128,61:28,carlsen,and I faked those ideas should not be
6131,61:31,carlsen,too successful so I'm just trying to
6131,61:31,firouzja,go H cravings okay I should just move
6134,61:34,carlsen,redeploy here Bishop g7 mmm yeah 97
6134,61:34,firouzja,around here and see what is going to
6137,61:37,firouzja,happen we shop is 695 for Daisy's idea
6144,61:44,carlsen,looks interesting in 2005 I guess I'm
6144,61:44,firouzja,but yeah he wants a 5 so how should I
6148,61:48,carlsen,just gonna go for that take a five I
6150,61:50,firouzja,put my pieces let's go here
6159,61:59,firouzja,[Music]
6201,62:01,firouzja,Knight of one I mean let's go before
6209,62:09,carlsen,suppose I think I got a fairly
6214,62:14,firouzja,[Music]
6215,62:15,firouzja,Queen c2 I think bad positions with
6219,62:19,carlsen,comfortable position here
6220,62:20,firouzja,right let's go here
6221,62:21,carlsen,Quincy - I'm just can't talk the King
6226,62:26,carlsen,away ships a fine
6229,62:29,firouzja,93 okay three I'm trying to perfectly
6231,62:31,carlsen,really sure what the bishop is doing
6232,62:32,carlsen,there
6236,62:36,carlsen,no7 there was not such an easy position
6240,62:40,carlsen,to play as a console to hear having to
6243,62:43,carlsen,to look for ideas
6243,62:43,firouzja,one so let's say Knight f4 we should be
6247,62:47,carlsen,yeah we got rid of that that ponen a sex
6248,62:48,firouzja,338 okay that's why I should say alright
6256,62:56,firouzja,that's connective one should be three
6300,63:00,carlsen,your phone is protected so that's not a
6303,63:03,carlsen,worry
6303,63:03,carlsen,I'd be several kicking the bishop away
6306,63:06,carlsen,oh I guess I'll just take it as a matter
6307,63:07,firouzja,they're just moving around this let's
6309,63:09,firouzja,see how okay just takes and cause 96
6313,63:13,carlsen,of fact these things not too much
6314,63:14,firouzja,okay so
6316,63:16,firouzja,[Music]
6319,63:19,firouzja,let's see what can I do okay one let's
6320,63:20,carlsen,happening Herod off you go if for
6325,63:25,carlsen,whenever I want not sure I really want
6326,63:26,firouzja,go to G find a fight simply g5 Robles is
6329,63:29,firouzja,move
6330,63:30,carlsen,that never okay one here's good at this
6333,63:33,firouzja,Rodriguez g5 but I don't see how he's
6334,63:34,carlsen,just keeping keeping the tension forcing
6336,63:36,firouzja,going to break so not see for let's
6338,63:38,carlsen,people to spend spend a bunch of time
6341,63:41,firouzja,connect it to might go c5 now okay I
6344,63:44,carlsen,okay yeah professional looks pretty good
6349,63:49,carlsen,but there's not that much to do and then
6350,63:50,firouzja,mean you could call it for afraid let's
6357,63:57,firouzja,see if he's going for it because genes
6358,63:58,carlsen,five Lorraine sleep okay yeah as I said
6359,63:59,firouzja,91 f3 g 3 queen a 5 pin gauge to cook a
6405,64:05,carlsen,the status quo is not great for me since
6408,64:08,carlsen,I'm a bit slower so I should try and try
6411,64:11,firouzja,robbery
6412,64:12,carlsen,and do something I guess native seven
6414,64:14,firouzja,let's see ninety seven out of seven dot
6416,64:16,carlsen,let's see four isn't so much I'm kind of
6420,64:20,carlsen,a knife 793 I'm taking take then he's
6421,64:21,firouzja,plus 95 95 okay let's go okay Sarah
6430,64:30,carlsen,got some good night so it's not clear at
6433,64:33,carlsen,all but I feel like I should be doing
6435,64:35,carlsen,okay okay seven
6444,64:44,firouzja,96 one problem much force near it goes
6446,64:46,carlsen,yeah
6453,64:53,firouzja,through t7 so nice if right he wants 52
6460,64:60,firouzja,it metaphor can create probably can
6505,65:05,carlsen,this I honest
6510,65:10,carlsen,you
6512,65:12,carlsen,I'll just go 95 16 your Tradeworks yeah
6513,65:13,firouzja,change I think but now he's wasting a
6516,65:16,firouzja,lot of time okay create an ID for just
6517,65:17,carlsen,dude I can't calculate just kind of crap
6523,65:23,carlsen,late let you fry at age 5 that was my
6530,65:30,carlsen,idea
6530,65:30,carlsen,I can't serve running away oh this is
6536,65:36,firouzja,age okay
6541,65:41,carlsen,clever doing take it come on so fucking
6605,66:05,carlsen,slow I could just have done it actually
6611,66:11,firouzja,she's insane
6612,66:12,firouzja,[Music]
6614,66:14,carlsen,that could be the point that wins me the
6614,66:14,firouzja,change tonight I should just give it to
6617,66:17,carlsen,match but he was just getting too
6619,66:19,carlsen,complacent he thought he'd flagged me
6619,66:19,firouzja,Mike and win the game man what's the
6622,66:22,carlsen,and then then I got this Wow yeah it's
6622,66:22,firouzja,game
6623,66:23,firouzja,what can I say okay let's try to win
6633,66:33,carlsen,not for the faint-hearted hearted huh
6633,66:33,firouzja,this game what can I do
6640,66:40,carlsen,okay let me try it go for this tape I
6640,66:40,firouzja,okay let's go d5 siscon 87 castle it
6647,66:47,carlsen,should be fine Turner with
6652,66:52,carlsen,that's
6656,66:56,firouzja,sings I don't know what to say okay you
6703,67:03,firouzja,won't say stick sticks takes rook e1
6705,67:05,carlsen,yeah nobody said it was easy no one ever
6705,67:05,firouzja,which visual design technology son okay
6710,67:10,carlsen,will be so hard
6714,67:14,firouzja,I feel like the fun this is my only
6719,67:19,firouzja,chance to win okay root gh I hope you
6724,67:24,carlsen,okay it's a bit tilty right though I
6725,67:25,firouzja,should be sneaks it takes I take so
6731,67:31,firouzja,probably goes d4 blowing castle once not
6732,67:32,carlsen,mean she knows that he probably is
6743,67:43,carlsen,playing such positions better than I am
6743,67:43,firouzja,a fun night I don't know
6745,67:45,carlsen,so in that sense is making a good choice
6745,67:45,firouzja,so thanks yeah probably nighter 493 but
6749,67:49,carlsen,here
6750,67:50,firouzja,Bishop g4 this is not very bad let's say
6752,67:52,carlsen,yeah like already messed up what am i
6801,68:01,firouzja,93 Bishop c4 will go for the endgame
6802,68:02,carlsen,doing
6805,68:05,carlsen,so I was thinking 93 buddy's got
6808,68:08,carlsen,efficient reform as it's just stupid you
6808,68:08,firouzja,should I go for the ingame h5 this is
6811,68:11,firouzja,the picture okay postage for me okay so
6812,68:12,carlsen,know age five when I'm just busted
6825,68:25,firouzja,we should with three Queen f3 and my h5
6829,68:29,firouzja,phone is rage so five was bad no problem
6837,68:37,carlsen,at the very least of Bishop f3 Queen f3
6838,68:38,firouzja,we don't make sure though let's take 36
6841,68:41,carlsen,Queen h4 h5 I'm still forcing the
6844,68:44,carlsen,exchange of Queens so it's not that bad
6844,68:44,firouzja,trying to play root of 6 and 6 here this
6848,68:48,carlsen,and it's probably good move bringing the
6851,68:51,carlsen,roof for
6859,68:59,carlsen,okay we can ice to do to counter that
6904,69:04,firouzja,is my only idea so I have to play it I
6907,69:07,firouzja,have a good points on center but is it
6911,69:11,firouzja,enough I'm not sure if you let's say
6912,69:12,carlsen,plan
6916,69:16,firouzja,brutish 195 31 953 cookies 7 ok maybe I
6925,69:25,carlsen,okay just like I'm thinking he was gonna
6930,69:30,firouzja,have to go looking 196 so okay the bus
6935,69:35,firouzja,route t1 look of war King give one to
6936,69:36,carlsen,wreck it for they can do this first of
6939,69:39,carlsen,course so I'm still hanging in there
6942,69:42,firouzja,give three 9 f3 loop t3 I don't like
6946,69:46,firouzja,that yeah let's go look for and look f3
6952,69:52,firouzja,Knight g4 9 th five look at five I have
6956,69:56,carlsen,sort of night five I guess roof T 494
6960,69:60,firouzja,so I think it blundered something here
7004,70:04,firouzja,way too good 5 he wants route before but
7005,70:05,carlsen,looks a bit unpleasant just wrap up my
7008,70:08,firouzja,okay 54
7014,70:14,firouzja,fifty-five shogunate c6 okay we can fix
7016,70:16,carlsen,own nights and manage not good got some
7024,70:24,carlsen,fire chances but I'm not optimistic
7024,70:24,firouzja,96 right blundering something you know
7028,70:28,firouzja,rocket for okay before this is not to
7034,70:34,firouzja,lose on time okay he blundered okay your
7043,70:43,firouzja,back stretch so now I think there are
7045,70:45,carlsen,sound it again okay I think I've
7047,70:47,firouzja,six week saying so let's go let's go
7049,70:49,carlsen,celebrated just way too early and I'm
7055,70:55,carlsen,just now it's six and a half
7101,71:01,firouzja,okay let's call it four I mean let's
7107,71:07,carlsen,all right so its first two two points
7110,71:10,firouzja,connect c3 I'm getting outplayed there
7112,71:12,carlsen,and multiple police don't recall that
7112,71:12,firouzja,so 93 Bishop c4 let's play this way t3
7115,71:15,carlsen,neither washer match goes for this
7120,71:20,firouzja,okay probably pro practice I don't know
7124,71:24,firouzja,[Music]
7126,71:26,firouzja,so let's see okay they go negative three
7127,71:27,carlsen,[Music]
7131,71:31,carlsen,do you 593 where's it playing so quickly
7131,71:31,firouzja,is done
7133,71:33,firouzja,95 we shot this stick so I go okay this
7137,71:37,carlsen,I don't get that it's nothing to be true
7138,71:38,firouzja,one cancel we shove these six
7145,71:45,firouzja,okay let's Bishop e7 so I take yeah
7146,71:46,carlsen,thrilled about here is there for him
7148,71:48,carlsen,should be 793 castles how the bishop
7150,71:50,firouzja,Queen f3 so let's go h3 we should be 651
7152,71:52,carlsen,pair okay yeah some problems were to put
7160,71:60,firouzja,I think like this
7206,72:06,firouzja,like it better here but I'm not sure
7207,72:07,firouzja,what a but I have to play it precisely
7209,72:09,carlsen,this particular mission
7210,72:10,firouzja,because he has two bishops so can i
7215,72:15,carlsen,don't really know what to do
7215,72:15,firouzja,donate see 555 95 it's possible I think
7217,72:17,carlsen,so I'm just gonna play quickly but you
7220,72:20,carlsen,certainly got some advantage Sharon that
7222,72:22,carlsen,he's
7225,72:25,carlsen,and that is fluid walk faster than I
7227,72:27,carlsen,have
7227,72:27,firouzja,95 we see it
7230,72:30,firouzja,well that Scobie should be three trying
7233,72:33,carlsen,so neither for a queen Quincy ate here I
7234,72:34,firouzja,to take on a 71
7238,72:38,firouzja,so because Queen c7
7239,72:39,carlsen,guess I guess I'm going Queen c7 before
7241,72:41,firouzja,we shall be 428 okay so we should be 595
7247,72:47,carlsen,Quincy ate I'll listen getting bit by
7250,72:50,carlsen,fire I think you should have taken the
7256,72:56,carlsen,bishop probably had the chance
7257,72:57,firouzja,Vagos 97 54 we should have 6 okay it is
7258,72:58,carlsen,thank you so I guess I go see if I at
7307,73:07,firouzja,very messy position I'm not sure watch
7309,73:09,firouzja,my mouth so let's call native for
7312,73:12,carlsen,some point but I'm allowing matter for
7315,73:15,firouzja,because we should t5 I got 23 okay got
7317,73:17,carlsen,my journey I'm playing way too
7323,73:23,firouzja,c5 s coffee shops d3 now I should attack
7328,73:28,firouzja,now my pieces are in a very good place
7331,73:31,carlsen,hesitantly here crispy it up I don't
7331,73:31,firouzja,so you should have 894 should be 5
7343,73:43,firouzja,Knight g5 okay he goes have 6 so that's
7349,73:49,carlsen,like this
7353,73:53,firouzja,cool like before this is a good move so
7358,73:58,firouzja,now once crazy c6
7401,74:01,firouzja,so let's go to the teacher what can go
7407,74:07,firouzja,wrong
7408,74:08,carlsen,and if ads just try to be solid want to
7408,74:08,firouzja,look v1 so Quincy seven ago
7416,74:16,firouzja,Quinn g3 and my g6 no no okay 23 let's
7426,74:26,carlsen,connect those rocks
7427,74:27,firouzja,see Quincy six he got Knight of 6 we
7431,74:31,firouzja,have 6 56 okay now it's not easy to
7432,74:32,carlsen,cringes 3 is massively annoying I kind
7436,74:36,firouzja,defend this exponent sure maybe g5 he
7439,74:39,firouzja,has to blame but that looks very risky
7441,74:41,carlsen,of think can I think yes I can't not
7444,74:44,firouzja,he 596 mmm so I'm threatening Knight of
7446,74:46,carlsen,think cuz what I'm doing without
7448,74:48,carlsen,thinking is just really bad and no
7449,74:49,firouzja,6 and because 96 ith okay late night of
7451,74:51,carlsen,instincts right now just none they're
7455,74:55,carlsen,all gone your position is just lost I
7459,74:59,firouzja,6 of these things now this is wrong
7500,75:00,carlsen,can I try this but I don't think he's
7503,75:03,carlsen,just listens yeah I think this just went
7505,75:05,firouzja,yeah this is meaning this is beneath so
7508,75:08,carlsen,from I was going to route the IPS clean
7513,75:13,firouzja,let's say Queen c7 the screening for I
7519,75:19,firouzja,might take here
7522,75:22,carlsen,so badly just absolutely disgusting I'm
7522,75:22,firouzja,let's not chop this okay tonight night
7527,75:27,firouzja,is 5 this is we need shop g7 okay it
7534,75:34,carlsen,completely lost
7541,75:41,firouzja,takes on d1 it's fine
7545,75:45,firouzja,right of 692 795
7554,75:54,firouzja,let's try 94
7555,75:55,carlsen,work if sex was resigns there this is
7558,75:58,carlsen,always still completely lost if you get
7602,76:02,firouzja,oh sure okay look these six everything
7607,76:07,firouzja,is on the tag so this is shalini yeah
7611,76:11,firouzja,this is very nice so yeah so I guess
7612,76:12,carlsen,bit of a mess so completely winning of
7615,76:15,carlsen,course
7617,76:17,carlsen,okay that's mate okay I'm just playing
7621,76:21,carlsen,so badly I got it I got it
7621,76:21,firouzja,you're seven I have 600 so one way is
7625,76:25,carlsen,just I really gotta get my own hand at
7626,76:26,firouzja,over
7627,76:27,firouzja,what okay before it goes 94 96 yeah
7629,76:29,carlsen,this point to know why I'm doing this
7633,76:33,firouzja,because III cancel I go c5 I mean that's
7644,76:44,firouzja,good t5 it takes so I will take and I
7653,76:53,carlsen,see the ad think this is not considered
7655,76:55,firouzja,don't think it's the point and go h6
7701,77:01,firouzja,this is a very solid position so should
7707,77:07,carlsen,that accurate supposed to be like a
7707,77:07,firouzja,I take not sure so I have to play fast
7711,77:11,firouzja,this is the important so Bishop with 496
7712,77:12,carlsen,little bit better here but whether I can
7715,77:15,carlsen,prove it that's not that's a very big if
7718,77:18,firouzja,Michael pointed to an technology six at
7721,77:21,carlsen,she just going through g4 okay I'm just
7722,77:22,firouzja,some point so nice it was g4 okay we
7726,77:26,carlsen,guess I'm just gonna go fridge
7729,77:29,firouzja,shall be 6 plus we should see 28 Luca g5
7733,77:33,carlsen,can always go Bishop c2 when i retrace
7736,77:36,carlsen,the attack d4 and now KH 1 i suppose
7739,77:39,firouzja,I think ok how can i play it's connected
7753,77:53,firouzja,suddenly if we cook
7757,77:57,firouzja,this is really the negative rate might
7800,78:00,carlsen,it's a bit weird okay Quinn d3 i
7802,78:02,firouzja,go Bishop III it wasn't even so he wants
7804,78:04,carlsen,affinity guess I'm going roof j1 claim
7808,78:08,carlsen,for g5 at some point yeah so so easy for
7813,78:13,firouzja,to five if I look in of 65 so here like
7817,78:17,carlsen,him to play her mm-hmm can go f4 guess
7827,78:27,firouzja,she says so if because Knight f4 I take
7831,78:31,firouzja,on before of course and if he goes okay
7835,78:35,firouzja,goes Bishop d2 winner six g5 let's
7837,78:37,carlsen,I'll come just continue developing for
7840,78:40,carlsen,the moment Queen f6 is left by 95 nah
7844,78:44,firouzja,develop this Bishop I gave him a 4
7849,78:49,carlsen,gotta wear for all right I'm missing
7850,78:50,firouzja,give him a 4 ok he's attacking this
7851,78:51,carlsen,something tactically I don't think so
7857,78:57,carlsen,this is probably a quite strong
7907,79:07,carlsen,yeah rook informant done at 5:00 it's
7911,79:11,firouzja,everything so let's connect a faith in
7915,79:15,carlsen,very very good
7919,79:19,carlsen,okay I'm just quite 5g Frey is coming

7937,79:37,carlsen,it's got 94 then Rooker for I don't
7943,79:43,carlsen,think he has anything there before takes
7946,79:46,firouzja,things
7946,79:46,firouzja,yeah sure okay yeah so for a hit finish
7956,79:56,firouzja,five takes takes Knight d5 stuff he
8006,80:06,firouzja,takes angle Queen and he takes ankle 95
8007,80:07,carlsen,Queen h5 still alive
8009,80:09,carlsen,which is a bit annoying okay take it
8012,80:12,firouzja,but then opens up a pitch shot so he
8017,80:17,firouzja,probably going to take a look when Jesus
8019,80:19,firouzja,no okay
8023,80:23,firouzja,native son should take right okay yeah
8032,80:32,carlsen,without the Queen his Kings it's gonna
8035,80:35,carlsen,be way too weak I think 23 yeah this
8035,80:35,firouzja,this is not good communicate mated me
8044,80:44,carlsen,just came over kitsch English sex
8048,80:48,firouzja,good this was

8128,81:28,carlsen,impressive
8130,81:30,firouzja,9250
8134,81:34,firouzja,[Music]
8138,81:38,carlsen,no I just scream these six Queens Queen

8453,84:53,carlsen,that tastes 95 that's a problem that's a
8458,84:58,firouzja,lowish should not be that bad I'm
8460,84:60,firouzja,non-threatening without six so probably
8500,85:00,carlsen,major problem for me don't like it at

8508,85:08,firouzja,time so let's go 95 if three it goes

8549,85:49,firouzja,be to put detail f4 okay I got some five

8607,86:07,firouzja,better here okay through this six seater
8619,86:19,carlsen,gonna lose this and the match that's
8622,86:22,firouzja,3294
8624,86:24,firouzja,let's see your chief five which 8h five
8629,86:29,carlsen,game over
8639,86:39,carlsen,it's absolutely game over so bad mate
8640,86:40,firouzja,okay
8645,86:45,firouzja,24 and Nate okay I think this was the
8651,86:51,firouzja,last game right
8652,86:52,carlsen,okay good game although that was really
8654,86:54,firouzja,is it finished or not okay
8655,86:55,carlsen,horrible
8655,86:55,carlsen,I mean I just was way out of shape but
8659,86:59,carlsen,he deserves full credits well I I just
8660,86:60,firouzja,Bucky yes thank you yeah okay I think
8703,87:03,carlsen,got to be better but now he's amazingly
8710,87:10,firouzja,going to match it was 5050 I don't think
8713,87:13,firouzja,I'm most favored or I don't think he was
8715,87:15,firouzja,favorite so it was 50/50 but yeah and
8718,87:18,firouzja,also you can see my results it's very
8721,87:21,firouzja,close so it should be a little bit lucky
8724,87:24,firouzja,and it was a strange that if this in
8727,87:27,firouzja,this time code in this state not that be
8730,87:30,firouzja,very very less times he was the boss it
8733,87:33,firouzja,was the guy flagging and I had been in
8736,87:36,firouzja,position I thought if you need other way
8739,87:39,firouzja,but yeah okay
8746,87:46,firouzja,okay it was it is it was not real big
8749,87:49,firouzja,because of course it is three minute and
8752,87:52,firouzja,opening is important but not as much of
8755,87:55,firouzja,course I saw some lines but not much of
8758,87:58,firouzja,course so like normal preparation I
8802,88:02,firouzja,prefer classical okay are you preparing
8805,88:05,firouzja,not supporting for the masters yes yes
8810,88:10,firouzja,of course it's a very great tournament
8812,88:12,firouzja,and it is very generous my records that
8816,88:16,firouzja,he did this tournament because it's very
8820,88:20,firouzja,good for fans and players and yeah so
8824,88:24,firouzja,the public wants to know how many hours
8825,88:25,firouzja,do you prepare to your study chess per
8828,88:28,firouzja,day okay it's depends on a day but the
8834,88:34,firouzja,only thing I think about is chess of
8836,88:36,firouzja,course it's not anything else maybe the
8841,88:41,firouzja,whole day okay that's why now you are
8844,88:44,firouzja,beating the world champion actually okay
8851,88:51,firouzja,how he's working the lockdown good year

8943,89:43,firouzja,already a lot we had some beans we had
8945,89:45,firouzja,some news but because of its rapids of
8948,89:48,firouzja,course I have some chances but of course
